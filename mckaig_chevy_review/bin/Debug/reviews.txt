Title: "Great vibe "
Review: I went too mckaig and knew exactly what I was looking for but didn't know how the process was going too be. Adrian was recommended too me from a great friend and also I would hear mckaig over the radio and I wanted to see for myself. So I headed there a day before my purchase and talked about the car I was looking into purchasing and Adrian very professional polite an honest told me the ups and downs and did explain an lead me too the car that I have today finally purchased. He was very professional and great person too help me too choose out a car. Talked too me about the car told me the specs about it without any hesitation. He is the one too go to if you are looking into getting a new car. Great atmosphere there at mckaig and great people they have working with them there in all I greatly consider them top in their profession. I could give Adrian a score it would be 110% with a gold star explainging it all too me and working with me. Giving his time too help me with a purchase of my new car Thank you very much.

Title: "Excellent "
Review: McKaig was the first place I went to to buy my first car. I chose to come here after hearing an employee rave about how friendly and helpful they were in helping her find a car that would fit her budget. It was everything she told me it would be and more! Brittany was extremely helpful and did everything she could to find the right car within my budget. I've already recommended this place to all my friends and family, it's more than worth the 45 minute drive there to me. Never did I think buying a car would be so pleasant but McKaig and Brittany have shown me it can be!

Title: "Easy to do business with.  I felt very appreciated."
Review: Pleasant experience for the whole transaction.  Sabrina went the extra mile to find the right pickup for me.  She is very knowledgeable about the inventory, terms, and product features.  Excellent attitude toward the dealership, products and the customer..  The whole transaction was a friendly, non pushy atmosphere.  I would go to McKaig first, the next time I want to purchase a Chevrolet.  I have visited other dealerships but the friendliness of McKaig  Chevrolet in Gladewater made the decisions easy.

Title: "They will do everything they can!"
Review: I absolutely love McKaig! Although I wasn't able to get a vehicle, I appreciate that they tried everything they could! 
Brittany let us know what was happening while we waited, what we needed, and how long they will keep our information. She was so patient and kind with my family and I. She really went above and beyond what was expected. It was the best experience that I've had at a dealership.

Title: "Thanks Jason"
Review: My experience with McKaig Chevrolet will always be remember as one of the greatest  moments  for looking for a vehicle.  From start to finish everyone was so helpful, friendly, Professional staff. All had made my experience a  very lasting impression.  No pressure,  non pushy and most of all willing to help see me get into a vehicle.  With me having some financial obstacles reflecting they went out of the way to find a lender that would work with me and my current situation and the results paid off. not only did I get approve,  but  I drove home in a brand new 2017  vehicle.  So if there  is hope for me  there is definitely hope for the  next person that is in need of a vehicle.  Don't let that stand in your way  Thanks Jason for helping me I appreciate you and I intend to purchase my next vehicle here as well.
