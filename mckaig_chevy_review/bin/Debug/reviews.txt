Title: "About 2 months ago, I had a minor auto emergency on my..."
Review: About 2 months ago, I had a minor auto emergency on my way to a job interview, and pulled into McKaig's for help. Everyone was super friendly, and said 'no problem, we can have you back on the way in no time.' I had never dealt with this dealership before but was completely blown away at how helpful and friendly they were to me that day. So there was no question when I went to buy my first new car, McKaig won hands down and had another AMAZING experience. Josh, the finance manager, was wonderful to work with. Being a first time buyer right out of college, I had no credit, and he did everything he could to get me approved for the needed amount without having ridiculously high interest rates. He also was sure to take his time and explain anything to me that I had any questions about. Phillip, the salesman I worked with, was outstanding. He worked for several weeks to find the exact car I wanted and traded with another dealership. He also took about an hour of his time after I bought the car to go over all the details. The ladies that work the front desk are super friendly. Overall, this is an awesome dealership. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to buy a new car.

Title: "AMAZING DEALERSHIP"
Review: My experience at this dealership was beyond great! In my lifetime I have bought several vehicles and I can honestly say that this was, hands-down, the best experience I have ever had. I will not go to another dealership from now on! Bruce Wike was an amazing salesman that went above and beyond to get my family and I in the best vehicle that would hold us all! On top of that, when I walked in with my four daughters, he made paper airplanes with them, paper poppers, and even answers a million questions from them! I have never had such friendly service at a dealership. Sabrina Preiss was also amazing and incredibly helpful when it came to all the exciting paperwork! I thought quality service like this was long gone! Thank you McKaig for the awesome experience, you guys are truly like NO OTHER dealership!!

Review: I bought my daughters 2011 Chevy Cruze from McKaig Chevrolet Buick in Gladewater yesterday.  This was my first time to do business with McKaig and I am so pleased!  This was a wonderful car buying experience!  Susie Scadden lined us up with Brian- an amazing sales associate.  Floyd worked the finance end of the deal and really hit the ball out of the park.  Great interest rate, awesome extended warranty and perfect payment.  The entire process, from test driving- selecting a car and finalizing the deal was a wonderful experience.  Brian &amp; Floyd both stayed after hours to meet me after work.  Then Brian invested extra time to make sure my daughter understood every function of her new car.  Thank you to the wonderful team at McKaig!  I highly recommend this dealership.

Title: "Amazing Dealership &amp; Even more amazing Sales people! "
Review: I had been stuck in a high payment for a year and a half and after hearing about Adrian at McKaig, I decided to give it a shot . Adrian was warm welcoming and carefully listened to my situation to better assist me . He allowed me to test drive a couple potential vehicles and I fell in love with my 2016 Chevy Malibu. Adrian helped me get into a lower payment and a brand new car . McKaig in Gladewater is truly a dealer for the people . They genuinely car about their customers and stepping into the dealership , you feel like a family. I 100% reccomend this dealer and especially Adrian. Sabrina Preiss is also amazing . She explains everything about the vehicle in clear terms and is very friendly ! She's awesome !

Review: I went too mckaig and knew exactly what I was looking for but didn't know how the process was going too be. Adrian was recommended too me from a great friend and also I would hear mckaig over the radio and I wanted to see for myself. So I headed there a day before my purchase and talked about the car I was looking into purchasing and Adrian very professional polite an honest told me the ups and downs and did explain an lead me too the car that I have today finally purchased. He was very professional and great person too help me too choose out a car. Talked too me about the car told me the specs about it without any hesitation. He is the one too go to if you are looking into getting a new car. Great atmosphere there at mckaig and great people they have working with them there in all I greatly consider them top in their profession. I could give Adrian a score it would be 110% with a gold star explainging it all too me and working with me. Giving his time too help me with a purchase of my new car Thank you very much.

Title: "Over 26 years trading cars with McKaig Chevrolet"
Review: Just purchased my 12th vehicle from McKaig Chevrolet Buick.  After all these years my wife and I discussed the possibility of her maybe exploring other car models (Ford, Nissan, Mini Cooper, etc.) thinking after all these years maybe she was ready to explore other options.  Ultimately we made the same decision we have for all these years for the same reasons.  Fantastic service, Fantastic people, great cars from Chevrolet and Buick - leaders in the industry, We live in Gladewater and dealing with Kent Abernathy (after years of dealing with Larry Aaron - the best ever) Mike Lambert was our salesman (or as they like to be called - Solutions Specialist) and Mike worked hard to find my wife the exact car she wanted - the exact color, style, interior and premium package.  I would recommend McKaig Chevrolet across the board!

Adrian Cortes is an amazing salesperson . He spoke with us in clear terms and his bilingual services were amazing ! He got us in a deal that was even better than our expectations ! He shows that he genuinely cares about his customers and not only just wants to be that pushy salesperson that only wants to sell . He actually helped us and we left VERY satisfied . The whole team at Mckaig's is completely amazing ! For those Spanish speaking customers, we reccomend Adrian Cortes 150% !!! We will MOST DEFINITELY be back for all of our vehicle needs !

Title: "This has truly been the best car buying experience that..."
Review: This has truly been the best car buying experience that we have had. We went in with an extremely narrow field of what would work for our large family and price range. Sabrina pulled all the pieces together and got us in a car I would have never dreamed of! Hello heated, leather seats! You can tell everyone here works as a team and for once it seemed like they really had an interest in what would work for us. Justin was able to work the financing so we would be able to even purchase specialty insurance without taking us out of our monthly budget.  Also, Rick was wonderful in keeping up with us - even checking in on the health of our children. I felt like I made friends instead of just buying a car. I didn't not feel pressured in any way. I believe that if I had told Sabrina that it wouldn't have worked with the vehicle she would have found something and if that didn't work, I know we would have left with her card and she would have been in touch with us to get us in what was just right for our family.I'm not really sure how she managed to get such a reasonable price on the vehicle and warranty but my husband and I were astounded and so very excited to be in something far nicer than we anticipated. They really do go to great lengths to make it work. We will recommend McKaig to all of our friends and family and most certainly be repeat customers.

Title: "I’ve always heard fantastic reports on McKaig Chevrolet..."
Review: I’ve always heard fantastic reports on McKaig Chevrolet in Gladewater, and they certainly lived up to all those reports! My husband and I stopped by to kill time before a doctor appointment and thought we would look at a few future possibilities. We were greeted by Brian Pilcher and from that point forward were on track to buying a vehicle. Brian was very informative and friendly during the entire process….and I should definitely mention, tolerant towards my indecisiveness! Joshua Hoenshell, Jeriamy Schumacher, and Brian all took on the challenge on getting me in a car, and I walked away with the best car buying experience I’ve ever had.   They gave me more for my trade then any other dealerships had offered, and were able to help me get what I wanted at a price I could afford.  We finally sat down with Jeriamy, who explained the “financial” side of the deal.  However, I also received a lesson in how to improve my credit and how to pay off my loans early. I genuinely felt like all three of the above gentleman cared about my husband and I, and worked hard in our favor.  I can honestly say that I have found my lifetime dealership and will recommend them to anyone who is looking for a fair deal and a friendly environment!

Review: I highly recommend McKaig Chevrolet!! They helped me tremendously! I am a cancer survivor and have had a battle over the last few years with several surgeries. I needed to down size due to all of the financial struggles that all of these surgeries assisted with so Floyd Rucks did an incredible job helping me trade my SUV for a more economical car. Floyd helped me get some rebates that made an even better financial deal on my new car. Brian Pilcher and Annette Preston were so friendly and helpful in showing me cars with better gas mileage than what I was getting. I decided on a new Chevy Malibu.  I couldn't be more happy &amp; satisfied with my new car and the deal that McKaig Chevrolet made me. A door was definitely opened for me when I met Floyd, Brian, and Annette. They were awesome!! As I was about to leave, Kent Abernathy (one of the owners) came outside to meet me before I could drive off. He was super nice &amp; great to talk to! They got their slogan right - they are definitely the &quot;dealer for the people&quot;!

Title: "I had researched pickup trucks on the internet and had..."
Review: I had researched pickup trucks on the internet and had decided to buy an almost new chevrolet pickup truck.  In one of my searches McKaig Chevrolet had a vehicle that met my criteria and only had slightly over 7,ooo miles.  I called and Josh answered the phone and although the dealership was about to close he took the time to answer all my questions about the truck that I was interested in.  I told him that I would be out of town the next week but that I would come see the truck the following Friday.  He thanked me for calling and we hung up.  The following Friday I didn't call because I thought the truck had probably sold.  Josh called me about noon and my wife and I drove to Gladewater to see the truck.  When we got there we met Josh and Phillip and they were extremely friendly and helpful.  They backed the truck into an open area where we could see it and open all the doors.  They explained what they knew about the truck and the options.  Right away I liked the truck and decided to drive it.  Josh told me where to drive, and identified an area that we could drive at highway speeds and really get a feel for the truck.  They made sure that we had plenty of gas and told us to take our time and enjoy ourselves.  We did just that and when we got back Phillip met us and we began to talk about the truck and he answered some questions that we had.  I liked the truck and made an offer and Phillip said, "Let's go talk to Josh and see what we can do."  There was no pressure, Josh accepted my offer and invited us to his office to do the paperwork.  That seems like a very small thing, but I researched the value of that type truck very throughly and I know my offer was reasonable but on the low side.  Josh made the decision and didn't try to get more money out of me.  I thought that was amazing.

From that point my buying experience was even better.  Josh was very through in the paperwork and my wife and I understood everything that we signed.  While we were getting the paperwork done Phillip had the truck cleaned, (it was already pretty clean), filled with gas, and serviced.  My wife and I have bought many cars in our lifetime, but this is the first one that the dealership provided a full tank of gas.  Before we left we were even introduced to the owner and found him just as pleasant and friendly as the rest of his staff.

In conclusion,let me say, I went in to this dealership to buy a used truck.  I could afford to buy anything I wanted but I had concluded that this represented the best value for me.  No one tried to sell me anything.  I was allowed to BUY what I wanted.  I was treated courteously and friendly and all my questions were answered.  The salespeople, Josh and Phillip, went out of their way to ensure that we were confortable and had the information that we needed.  This was one of the best car buying experiences that I have ever had and I will return as I have need for service or future vehicles.  I certainly will recommend this dealership to my friends.

My Thanks to McKaig Chevrolet.

Title: "Initially I came to McKaig Chevrolet on the recomendation..."
Review: Initially I came to McKaig Chevrolet on the recomendation of a co-worker and friend to do business with Phillip Anderson.  I have been doing business with McKaig Chevrolet for years buying new vehicles for myself, co-signing on new vehicles with both my nephew and my niece to get them started in buying cars for themselves and establishing a good credit rating as they entered adulthood. I, also, brought my father to McKaig's to buy a vehicle.  Phillip has always been very thorough and fair in listening to what I preferred and getting the best deal for me with all the specifications I requested.  After buying my vehicles, Phillip and all the rest of the staff have always been very courtious, professional and still maintained the family, friendly atomosphere of doing business with people you can really trust.  I have recommended McKaig's to all my co-workers, family, and friends alike as a place with quality vehicles, great service, and wonderful people with which to do business.  I am currently driving my second Impala and I love a good Chevrolet.  It is a great car for me and comfortable for my passengers when I have them.  We have made several long trips and many, many short trips and this car is just very comfortable, dependable as well as looking classy.  I will continue to buy my vehicles from McKaig and to take them in for regular service and will always recommend them to anyone looking for a place to buy a vehicle.

He was considerate of our financial situation and made sure to speak to us very confidentially.  Once we decided on a vehicle, we met with Jeriamy to finalize the sell.  He was efficient and caring with his approach to taking care of all financial arrangements.  We have bought may vehicles from several dealerships in various states.  Never once have we had such a welcoming, pleasant, friendly, un-pressured experience.

Title: "Great Buying Experience"
Review: I am from White Oak and recently purchased a 2012 Chevrolet Silverado at  Mckaig. My sales person was Michael Odom. I knew what I was looking for when I went in so Michael simply showed me what he had similar to what I had in mind. He was very friendly and never pushed me to buy a more expensive truck. Michael answered all of my questions and made my buying experience a pleasure. I would also like to mention Sabrina Preiss. She was very friendly and helpful with all the paperwork. Overall this was a friendly and relaxing buying experience.

Title: "Great experience"
Review: I got our new truck from the dealership in Gladewater, Tx. The service provided to us was outstanding. Our dealer, Adrian, never gave up and was determined to help. He was the best dealer we came across, and was an amazing dealer. Our sales manager, Sabrina, and finance manager, Susie, were really nice, and explained everything extremely well. Together they all made a huge impact on our lives, and we are ecstatic we came into this dealership. When things were starting to look down these three people brought our hopes back up and made our day in more ways then one. Will definitely stay loyal. Great service and overall amazing experience.

Title: "An amazing experience"
Review: From the time that McKaig first contacted me till I walked out the door with keys to my brand new 2012 Dodge Ram 1500 it was a great experience.  The friendly Solution Specialist Mike Lambert did everything in his power to make sure I drove away in this truck. they gave me full blue book value for my trade and it helped a lot with the overall price. Mike was probably the nicest guy among many at that dealership and he stayed the course to make sure everything worked out in my favor.  The fact that they are a small town dealership moving a lot of cars like the big dealerships is very impressive. I saw 5 other people drive away in something new including my co-worker Ryan Harrigan, who drove away in a new truck also.  The over experience was one to talk about.  This dealership did everything to help out any situation that arose and I truly thank them from the bottom of my heart for the dedication they showed with getting me my new truck.

Thank you McKaig for everything!!

Cheers,

Review: They are very friendly (most dealer ships are) but the difference is they seem more genuinely friendly. Most dealers say all kinds of friendly things up front but then you get pushed around alot, not here! Adrian was very helpful and sweet and he and his management team were able to help me get out of a hard situation and into a brand new car with NO INTEREST! They were very accommodating even when they were a little backed up on closings (had to wait a little while), but they made up for it. Great place, great service, GREAT PERKS!

Review: My husband and I were searching online for a new truck and ran across the McKaig Chevrolet website. I called and spoke to Sabrina, who was very helpful with providing pricing and scheduling us an appointment. We drove to Gladewater that day and meet with Annette. Annette was very helpful and great to work with. We bought a 2013 Chevy Silverado that day and Floyd handled everything out with the payment to stay within our budget. A few weeks later my husband decided that the truck we had bought did not fit his needs so I called Annette to check about possibly upgrading it. We drove back and she had trucks ready for us to test drive. That day Jeriamy worked out our payments and we bought a 2014 Chevy Silverado. Johnny Ortiz worked on getting all the paper work. Johnny is friendly and a very funny guy! The whole team at McKaig was very friendly and we would recommend this dealship to our friends and family. Annette is Awsome and very knowledgeable and if she doesn't know it she will find out!! We would definately call Annette when we are ready to buy our next vechile!

Title: "The very best experience ive ever had buying a vehicle."
Review: Hello my name is Patricia Thompson and I want to say McKaig Chevrolet Buick in Gladewater is by far the very best experience ive ever had buying a vehicle and Ive bought several over the years. Most places you go are pushy and u end up buying something you dont want. But this place McKaig I highly highly recommend. Johnny Ortis I believe is his last name  he was so nice to me the day before at my place of employment. when I met him and found  out where he worked I just so happen to be looking for a truck and had been for 6 months. I decided thats where I was going. So I arrived there and had a truck in mind to see. Charles Phillips a solutions specialist  greeted me. He was so very nice he got my information, asked several times if I would like something to drink. He deffinately went above and beyond to make my experience very pleasent. He brought the truck for me to see and that was the one then Jeriamy Schumacher and Sabrina Priess got me approoved for the vehicle I wanted . Not only did they work very hard to get my payments where I wanted them but also they got my psyments lower and that included a full warranty for the life of my loan. That was so awsome. I highly recommend them at McKaig every one there was so nice. Even others who were not working with me specifically asked how I was doing and if I needed anything .most places if there not working with you specifically they dont even acknowledge you. But every one there was awsome. Kat I want to metion too shes so nice and answered all my questions I had the night before going to McKaig Chevrolet Buick. I would do it again for sure.

Title: "Best dealership EVER!!!!"
Review: This is my third vehicle to purchase from Brian, and he is the best salesman I have ever had the pleasure of doing business with. I was looking to upgrade to a truck, but my credit is not the best. I explained to Brain what I was looking for, and he went right to work for me. He had to jump through SEVERAL hoops that I didn't know if it was going to be possible, but that is what makes him the best ever! I was expecting to get a low end truck that would just have to do, but I was able to leave in a 2013 loaded out Ford F-150 with only 28,000 miles that is way way more than I expected to leave with. They were able to get me in an awesome truck and we're actually under the budget that I told them. Jeremy and Sabrina were also working super hard on the financial end to make the deal work and get me approved. They all refused to give up and stayed well after closing to ensure that I was well taken care of and left in anew awesome truck. I cannot say enough good about the team that McKaig Chevrolet has. If you are looking for a nice vehicle, do not even consider going to any other dealership. You can skip all the hassle and stress and just make McKaig your first stop.

Now we are looking forward to the service side here it is just as great as the buying side.

Review: I love going to this dealership.  The people treat you like family.  They know you by name.  They know exactly what you need and what you want out of your car. Their people don't pressure you into buying something you don't want.  They find you exactly what you want and work very hard to put you in the exact car that you are looking for.  

The service team is above excellent.  I have never had a problem with Doyle Dugan or any of his service team members.  They take care of all of my needs and get it done right the first time.

The parts team is excellent as well.  I have only had to call upon them a couple of times for headphones, etc. and they were right on my request and held my items until I could get there to pick them up.  

The front office staff is impecable.  They know all about the family and have seen my kids grow over the 12-year relationship we have had with the dealership.  They make you feel like a member of their family.

We just recently found out a longtime salesman who we have used sevearl times in the past has gone on to new things, but Kent made me feel comfortable with using any of the other salesmen.  He even offered his own expertise when we were ready to purchase another vehicle to make us even more comfortable.  We will definitely make every Chevrolet purchase from their dealership.

had to  get the best possible price on the car we decided on buy. It didn't take long for us to find the car we wanted. We were able to purchase it within our budget, then Mike really helped us to understand the  many extras and how   to understand how they operated. The owner  of
the Company spent time with us to answer any questions we  might have had and express  his appreciation. for our purchase.  If you are considering buying a car, I would highly recommend you try McKaig  Chevrolet and speak with Mike Lambert.

Review: We discovered McKaig through the Chevrolet website. McKaig had the truck that had everything I was looking for. The minute we walked into the door we were greeted by this lady with a big smile, full of Texas charm and hospitality...Sabrina Preiss!  She was very thorough in explaining about their dealership, as well as the vehicle I was interested in. Throughout the process of negotiations, she was very professional and precise.  I believe it ended in a win-win for all parties. I would recommend my family, my friends, and anyone who asked me to go to McKaig before going anywhere else. And, of course, I would further recommend they ask for Sabrina., but I'm partial. All ttheir personnel we came in contact with were very friendly and tried to help us in any way they could. The service department well surpassed our expectations. Okay, now on a personal note:  I am a young female senior and this is my first pickup truck. My husband says its a luxury truck on steroids....2014 Ruby Red Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LTZ Texas Edition Pickup.  I'm in love with it!!!  Go visit McKaig.

Review: After searching for a new/ used car for days, I finally decided that I would see what McKaig had to offer. I've heard the commercials and decided I'm tired of the run around; lets do this! I made a call to the dealership and asked to speak with the finance manager, Jeriamy. He was working late on a Saturday evening and never once hesitated to tell me to come on over. With the help of Stephen (sales) and Jeriamy (finance) I was there for only a couple hours and drove off the lot same night with my new car. After having been to several other dealerships the same day and getting no where fast these guys truly cared about my family, my finances and my needs without putting me into another financial strain. I received fast, friendly customer service with a smile (even though it was 11:00pm when we completed my deal). I have bought two vehicles at McKaig now and will continue to grow business year after year with this A++ dealership. I couldn't have asked for an easier transition from one car to another and outstanding accommodations for me and my family were made through Jeriamy and Stephen. Thank you McKaig for allowing me to better my credit and to drive a nicer, newer car without the hassle I received at a few other larger lots!!! My experience at McKaig and the help of these outstanding sales/ finance professionals truly sets the McKaig difference apart from the other guys. McKaig holds strong to their word -- they are definately my new &quot;dealer FOR the people&quot; for LIFE! I can't say enough, how much I appreciate their hard work, late hours and how well they took care of me through the whole process without ever giving up on ME or my deal! This makes them OUTSTANDING IN THE DEALER WORLD FOR ME. I will continue to refer my friends and family to McKaig over and over again! Thank you JERIAMY AND STEPHEN!! YOU both set your dealership apart from the &quot;normal&quot;. SO, if you are in the market for a nicer, newer ride; you are doing yourself an injustice to visit any other lot - GET over to MCKAIG and see how they WILL make a difference for you! Again, much appreciation for your outstanding service!

Review: Although purchasing a new vehicle can be thought of as a painful process, McKaig does their absolute best to ensure that customer feels &quot;at ease&quot;. I was a difficult sell; being as the vehicle I was looking for was somewhat of a rare bird. McKaig stuck with me the whole way and made sure what i wanted was exactly what i got! McKaig's friendly service coupled with their standard for excellence is a combination that can win over even the most challenging of customers. Please don't just take my word for it. If your in the market for a new vehicle go see the great folks at McKaig and get a feel for not just good but great service. To all the great folks at McKaig thank you for making buying a new vehicle anything but painful!

Sincerely,

Review: When I began my search for a new car, I knew I wanted to find a local &amp;quot;hometown&amp;quot; dealer with a sales rep I could sit down with face to face and feel comfortable that I was getting the best product for my money. I wanted to work with a dealer who would listen to what I wanted and not try to push me into buying a new car until I was ready and I wanted to be sure that if I had any problems with the new car, the dealership would take care of me. McKaig Chevrolet exceeded all my expectations. The staff treated me like I was family. They were friendly, knowledgeable and most of all fair and honest. This was the easiest car buying experience I've ever had. The  finance guru, Josh, had the paperwork waiting on me. My sales representative, Mike Lambert, sat me down in the car and showed me how to use everything the car had to offer and answered all my questions. And I know Kent Abernathy and all of the staff at McKaig is just a phone call away if I need anything. I totally trust these great people and would recommend McKaig Chevrolet to anyone looking to buy a new Chevy.

Review: My Mom and I had a great experience at McKaig Chevrolet. She was in need of a new vehicle and this dealership is very convenient for her. Our sales consultant was Phillip Anderson...he did a great job of showing us the features of the Chevy Cruze and maybe more important is that he made my Mom feel very comfortable with her buying decision. She and I met several associates at the dealership...making her feel that she was in good hands. Our experience was great, they were very friendly and we were very satisfied with the deal that we received on the Cruze.
We highly recommend McKaig Chevrolet in Gladewater.

Review: Love my new car! We were greeted promptly and courteously.  We test drove the LaCrosse and were sold.  It sells itself, but Mike did a great job.  He answered all our questions and explained all the features thoroughly.  This car is replacing a BMW, which I thought couldn't be beat, but I was wrong.  We took a road trip just after purchasing the car, and were so pleased with its' performance.  The  car is so smooth, quiet, and comfortable.  We are usually tired after four or five hours on the road,being 73 &amp; 70, but the seats on our new LaCrosse were the most comfortable ever. We are also pleased to have local service on both our vehicles, the 2011 Enclave and the LaCrosse.  We bought the Enclave (2nd one) last year, so we have first hand knowledge of Doyle and the great service department. Everyone we dealt with was friendly and helpful.

Sincerely,

Review: I was not picked off by a vulture the minute I got out of my car. I went in I was greeted warmly and directed to a sales associate. He then went over their Customer Bill of Rights. Which is exactly how everything went. It was a great car buying experience. They never tried to put me in a car they knew I would never qualify for instead they first figured out what I would qualify for with my trade and down payment and showed me the vehicles I could afford. It was wonderful. I love my new SUV. It has everything I was looking for and I can afford it!

Adrian Cortes helped find the vehicle in the color I wanted and helped me to understand all the features of the new vehicle. If you are looking for a new vehicle, go see Adrian at McKaig.  He is the nicest guy in the world and he goes above and beyond any other car salesman I have dealt with previously.   Adrian actually brought a Tahoe to Mineola so I could test drive it!  I also have to give a shout out to Sabrina Preiss.  She helped get the price where I needed it to be in order to trade vehicles.  These are two of the best employees at McKaig so go see them for your next vehicle.  The won't disappoint!  Thanks Adrian &amp; Sabrina for making my car buying experience a positive one!!

Review: Mckaig Chevrolet in Gladewater, TX really went above and beyond what they should have to help me be able to get in my first new vehicle in about 17 years. Charles Phillips is an awesome salesman that went way out of his way to help me out. He even came to the dealership on his day off to make sure my car was cleaned and ready for me and even took the time to show me everything on the car and how it worked. Can't say enough about his loyalty and commitment to his customers. Lisa Bryant also took the time to help me through the process and even gave great advice on how to pay my car off quicker. Maybe wish I wouldn't have been so nervous and haggled a little on the price, lol, but very satisfied with my payments and so very blessed to have this new car with tons of room for me and my daughter to be comfortable in and enjoy. Thank you Mckaig Chevrolet, Charles, and Lisa for all of your help and your kindness to your customers.

Review: I have had Mckaig service our 2007 H3 Hummer for six years.  On April 19, 2007, I brought it in for a minor recall install.  While waiting, I met Mike Lambert in sales and asked about used pickups.  He mentioned a 2013 Silverado with low mileage, excellent condition in/out and at an affordable price.  Later that day, my wife and I returned and Mike worked with us to get a fair price for our Hummer and a fair price for the Silverado at a great interest rate.  The finance gal was Sabrina Preiss who did a great job of getting us thru the paperwork.  We can't thank Mike and Sabrina enough for making the car buying experience a truly enjoyable one.

Title: "Purchase of new 2015 Traverse"
Review: We would not have traveled so far to Gladewater, TX from our residence in Hallsville, TX had it not been for Ashley Anderson's thoughtful reminders that we had once expressed interest in purchasing a vehicle via Internet. Periodically, Ashley would send us &quot;text messages&quot; assuring us that we would be really excited if we would come visit McKaig Chevrolet Buick. She told us that they had a wide selection. Ashley also arranged for us to meet with one of their finest sales solution folks, Mr. Bruce Wike. ~ Wow! She was exactly correct. Bruce Wike took us under his wing and addressed each and every concern we had about choice of vehicle and financing a vehicle. Mr Bruce Wike is a kind &amp; gentle man with an eye for genuine needs that are distinctly different from someone who is trying to fill their latest fancy, which he would gladly help such a person fulfill their inner craving for that &quot;just-right&quot; vehicle. As Bruce listened to our need for a safe and dependable vehicle (one that would fit); he suddenly became a solution finder, our personal representative with McKaig Chevrolet Buick. Mr. Jeriamy Schumacher worked very hard to arrange financing for us. Once financing was arranged Bruce introduced us to Sabrina Preiss. This lady seemed to be so professional in preparing all the paperwork for the financing, titling, and registering of our new Traverse. She went the extra mile with us by staying and working late to get everything accomplished that would allow us to drive home in our new car that day. What a TEAM!! McKaig Chevrolet Buick is the dealership to visit for your personal needs and/or vehicle dreams come true. Sincerely, Dave &amp; Lois Ashworth

I always shop at least three dealerships before going to McKaig's and they always provide the best price.  I dealt with Mike Lambert and have known him for years. I've never met a more friendly sales person than Mike.  He is polite, courteous, and thorough and also very knowledgeable of General Motor products. He is very easy to bargain with and gives me the best possible price. He didn't quit with the final sale. At the completion of the sale, he went with me to my new truck and showed and demonstrated all it's options and features. He even called my insurance company and transferred the policy to my new vehicle.

  In about a week mike called and said it was in and to make an appointment with dole to have it installed and I did and mike gave us a loaner till we got ours back 
  That's why I go to mckaig because even after the sale mike takes care of us and dolye has always done us right .
      During and after the sale Mike goes  beyond the call of duty to see to it that his customer's are taking care of ,and Doyle in the service  department has always done a great job for us that's why I take all my cars to him from an oil change to tires and even for tires on my trailers they always have competed  prices and treat us like family

Title: "When I first pulled into McKaig Chevrolet I was kind of..."
Review: When I first pulled into McKaig Chevrolet I was kind of nervous about purchasing another car.  I had concerns about the pricing and car note.  But when I talked to Brian about the things I needed in another car and the price that I was set on, he quickly went to work to find me a good car for a good price.  Not only did he find me a good car, but the McKaig team was able to get me a price LOWER than what I had stated.  The service was awesome, everyone was very nice and friendly, and Brian made sure that all of my questions were answered efficiently.  I love my car, and I LOVE the price that I was able to get it at.  Not only would I recommend others to go to McKaig, but I think McKaig just found a new life long shopper in me.

Annette Preston and Jeremy Schumacher are the most awesome people you would EVER want to meet. If you have them working for you on getting a new or used vehicle, you'll drive off in one that day.

Review: Probably the easiest Car Sales experience I have been through. My wife and I were looking for a car for my daughter who is in college. I checked out several websites and finally came upon a car I was interested in on Autotrader. After making a call to the dealership we decided to make the trip to Gladewater to check the car out. We were first greeted by a receptionist who was very friendly. She contacted Kent Abernathy who took us out the shop to show us the car.He made us feel very welcome and relaxed. We looked it over , went for a test drive and decided to discuss terms. After agreeing on the price, we were then introduced to Josh Johnston who handled the paperwork. He was also very friendly and professional. We drove the car back to Shreveport and are very satisfied with McKaig Chevrolet. I would definitely recommend.

Review: We had a wonderful experience with McKaig Chevrolet!  The price we paid for the vehicle we were looking for was outstanding!  We reside in another state and McKaig went out of their way to help us out.  Because we shopped via internet/phone, we had to make many phone calls to the dealership and Josh was very patient and helpful!  The shopping experience was very easy; quite a contrast from other dealerships I had communicated with while we were searching for the right vehicle at the right price.  The transaction of purchasing the vehicle went very smoothly and easily as well; we never even set foot on their lot.  Once we purchased the vehicle, Josh continued to be a help with questions we had as well as Doyle with the service department.  We would recommend all our friends and family to McKaig even though they're several hundreds of miles away!

Review: I was highly impressed with this dealership, they went above and beyond to find the best deal and best value for my trade in. Everyone at the dealership went out of their way to make sure that everything I needed was taken care of. The price they initially gave me was the price that I paid for the vehicle they didn't try to come in at the end of the deal and tell me there were fees for this and that. They were very honest and made me feel like they were on my side and we were working together to get my new vehicle rather than me trying to fight them for the best price. I would highly recommend this dealership to anyone, even if you are not from this area it would be well worth your time to make a trip to see them. From now on all of my vehicles will come from Mc Kaig.

Title: "My husband and I looked for almost a year trying to find..."
Review: My husband and I looked for almost a year trying to find the truck of "MY" dreams!!! We were dealing with so many dealerships and talking to so many sales men it was nerve racking!!! Back in late November I had told my husband that I had, had enough and I wasn't looking any longer until after the holidays! It was really discouraging! Every sales person we had dealt with was always wanting to push something on me that I didn't want!!! I was even willing to purchase an used truck if necessary to get what I was looking for and in the price range that I (we) knew we could afford! On Saturday, January 17, 2009 I was watching television and a commercial for the McKaig dealership in Gladewater, Texas came up! It was as if they were talking to me!!! And yes, I know they weren't but the commercial got my attention and I went online to check them out! As I clicked in my information on their website, "My" truck came up!!! It was exactlly what I had been looking for for almost a year! I emailed McKaig and Mr. Josh Johnston called me on Monday morning! Talking to him was so awesome because everything that he said not only was what I wanted to hear, it was THE TRUTH!!! 

They had the very truck that I wanted and was so looking for on their lot and within our price range! We filled out the paper work on Monday and took posession of our truck on Tuesday! It was that simple! Mike and Josh are amazing people ... Everyone at McKaig are wonderful! I've been in there several times since we bought the truck to have it serviced with scheduled oil changes and tire rotations and we now even take my husbands 1/2 ton '99 Chevrolet Silverado in there for servicing! Everytime I talk to anyone at McKaig for any reason they are the sweetest nicest people I've ever dealt with! They are always there to answer any questions about our trucks and always there to help us in any way they can! 

I love my truck!!! We bought a 2009, 2500 HD, 4x4 Chevrolet Silverado and it ROCKS! I love everything about it! EVERYONE AT McKAIG Chevrolet/Buick are AWESOME!!! They have a GREAT team from sales to service! I recommend McKaig to everyone I know especially if they are looking to buy!

Betty & Don deGeurin

Title: "Totaliy Awesome People :)"
Review: Hi, I'd been looking for better than a month after having my vehicle totaled. I'm a paraplegic and only certain vehicles work for me. I'd been specifically looking for Honda Elements and and Y'all had one in Gladewater, so after a couple calls I stopped by and visited with Mike Lambert. We test drove it and basically my only concern was the lack of a driver-side armrest which he said he'd look into for me, I then gave him a price I was comfortable with and was on my way. Within two days I called back and he'd found a center console online and agreed with my offer. At the same time I'd been researching armrests and consoles myself for which I choose to take care of myself. (Even thought what he'd found would have worked)   

Anyway, I'm writing this review because Mike couldn't have been a nicer and easier person to deal with, which surprised me as other places I'd been to, well lets just say NOT!

As a matter of fact. Everyone there was great. You don't see that much anymore and that's something I value and appreciate more than words can express!!! 

And I don't want to forget Sabrina Preiss :) She's a hoot! Very nice lady.................

Title: "This place changed my outlook on dealerships "
Review: My trip to Mckraig Chevrolet Buick was an overall wonderful experience to say the least. I walk in to be instantly greeted by Michael Odom. The car that I brought in was in sad shape, and all I could think is that this dealership would not be able to help me due to my past experience with dealerships. I was completely wrong. This dealership went above and beyond to make sure that I was able to get into a dependable vehicle that I actually liked. Jeriamy Schumacher was friendly and did not take a break until he was sure he tried every option to help me into a loan. Michael Odom checked on me through the whole process and became excited with me when I finally was approved for the car. He also made sure to explain all the features of the car, which was the most important thing to me. Sabrina Preiss was a complete delight while signing paper work. She was very thorough and broke the things I did not understand down. This dealership went above and beyond for me. I went in thinking I would never get approved for anything and left in a brand new, 2017 Chevy Spark. I highly recommend mckraig if you are in the market for a new vehicle. These guys really are for the people!

Review: I bought my 2016 car a few months back so it is still under warranty. The remote start stopped working so I called the service dept to see if I could bring it in. I spoke to Shannon Wheeler who was able to get me in quickly on my preferred day of service. Because the parts needed to be ordered to fix, they gave me a nice courtesy vehicle to drive for two days. The staff were very friendly, reliable, convenient, and kept me up to date on my car. I'm very happy with the full car experience from the purchase day with Bruce, to the free oil change and the current service with Shannon Wheeler and his knowledgable staff. My father has done business with McKaig for years and refuses to go anywhere else. He says, if they don't have it- they will find it for you.  They seem honest, don't send out the stupid gimmick junk mail and seem to value and respect their customers. They are professional but also down to earth, un-intimidating, and approachable. Me being a single, working mother- I feel they have really taken care of me. Plus, my name is Shannon and with a name like Shannon-- well, ya can't go wrong!  McKaig for President--- Shannon Olvera

Title: "Wonderful Dealership Experience"
Review: Wonderful. Dealership. Experience!!!  I have bought several cars over the years and this was by far my best experience.  I felt the usual dread walking into the dealership.  It seems that buying a car is a must and although it should be a fun experience, over the years, it has rated below going to the dentist.  I have sat across the desk and wasted more time than I have ever wanted trying to understand the numbers, haggling for a price, listening to sales pitches, and waiting... waiting for the sales manager, waiting for the finance manager... back and forth and back and forth until you are so relieved to be leaving that you can't even appreciate the car you just bought.

This was not my experience here!!  I did not have a salesman at this dealership.  I was greeted by a solution specialist!  Bruce focused on my wants and needs and then figured out a way to get me in the car that I needed and wanted.  There was no pressure or sales talk.  There was a genuine and sincere interest in making a deal happen for me that made me happy.  Bruce went above and beyond before and after the sale.  In fact, every person in the dealership was helpful and friendly.  I ended up leaving with a new car,  an understanding of all the features on the car, and a smile on my face.  

This is how buying a car should feel!  I will caution you on one thing and that is be ready to commit yourself to a Buick or Chevrolet for life.   I cannot see ever walking into a different dealership after the great experience that I had here.

Our preference is to always do business with small town people, and we were pleased to leave in a beautiful new Traverse.  In the future, I will gladly recommend this dealership to anyone interested in a good deal with an even better staff.

Review: The guys were very helpful in answering all my questions. They gave me plenty of options to chose from and one once I decided on the vehicle I wanted to purchase signing all the paperwork was a breeze. Brian helped me get all my stuff switched over from my old truck to my new one and Jeremy got all the financing straight. Floyd sat with me for over two hours explaining my credit scores, my payment plan, and my warrantee. All of the employees at McKaig were so friendly, introducing themselves and overall making me feel comfortable. I will definitely buy my next vehicle from McKaig and refer friends and family to them as well!! Thanks for all your help!!

Review: We went to Mckaig Chevrolet to purchase a Suv and they went above and beyond to make it possible for us. We have had credit problems in the past but they didnt just throw us to the way side. They worked really hard and even stayed well after time that they should have been going home so that they could help us. We have went to several car dealers that wouldnt even return our call bc we didnt have perfect credit... they were the exact opposite they actually called me and asked me to come in. Jeriamy and Brian were so nice they didnt talk down to us or make us feel bad for our past problems. They got us in what we needed and wanted and even gave us some helpful tips to help get our credit on a positive track. It was not just Jeriamy and Brian but everyone at McKaig was so friendly and patient with us that we will never shop any where else. They truelly are the best in East Texas!!!!

I told them over the phone what I wanted and they handled every question and request I made very promptly and professionally. I told them what my situation was and they made sure that they handled my needs in a very timely manner. When we drove up to the dealership they greeted us at the door with a very friendly and professional attitude. Not one but three gentlemen came to meet me and my wife to make sure we were made welcomed. I was very impressed with the open and sincere attention we were given. This is by far the most pleasant situation I have experienced in buying a new vehicle. At this time McKaig will most definitely be the first one's that I would be willing to deal with. They made both me and my wife feel like they were genuinely sincere in wanting to give us the best possible deal and service. I would highly recommend them to my friends as a great place to purchase their next vehicle.

On September 23, I had the day off and decided to go with my boyfriend to the dealership in person to meet her.  She was taking a lunch break so Mike Lambert started helping us.  After looking at several used vehicles and needing to put money down for a used vehicle, Jeriamy suggested to Mike to see if he could get us into a brand new vehicle with no money down and awesome rebates.  We saw the vehicle and I fell in love with it.  There was negotiating going on and it had happened as luck would have it.  Mike said it was a done deal and Sabrina went over the contract with us and I am now a proud owner of my very first Brand New Vehicle.

He was very helpful and did not try to pressure me when showing me vehicles I was interested in within my price range.  During the process, I met both Jeriamy Schumacher and Sabrina Preiss.

Sabrina was great at explaining all the paperwork. She went over all options that were availablefor this used Tahoe. When I picked up the car it had been a total of 3 days.!!!

I was stuck in a 2004 Nissan with well over 100,000 miles that I was paying WAY to much for. They put me in a BEAUTIFUL 2015 Car, with my monthly payment the same. THE SAME as my beat up old car. Mike was GREAT, he gave me options, good ones at that. He was very friendly and kept us talking and entertained during the short wait to hear about financing. Then, we met Alisa, she explained all the warranties, and options we had to choose from in a way that normal people (who don't shop for cars often) could understand. Sabrina was also great and kept us laughing while filling out paperwork. Overall, the staff was very friendly and made us feel very welcome. I would definitely recommend McKaig to friends or family.

Title: "Awesome!"
Review: I was in the market for a quality used vehicle, and to receive a fair trade in value for my car. I heard McKaig's add on the radio and they claimed to be a dealer for the people, sure, sounds like another used car salesman right?, WRONG!!! They were the best staff and so helpful. Mike Lambert and Floyd Rucks gave me several options to choose from that were in my price range, and didn't pressure me to make a decision. I fell in love with a 2010 Cheverolet Equinox and I feel like I got it at a really fair price. I would recommend and actually have to several people.

Title: "I called Mike because the last Mini Van I had bought from..."
Review: I called Mike because the last Mini Van I had bought from him now had over 120K on it and my wife was traveling a lot. The van had been an excellent vehical that I purchased from Mike in 2004. He recommended I look at Mckaig's web site to see what was available. I found a 2013 Chevy Cruze LTZ. that looked great. I asked Mike if it was a good one as I trust him because this is the third used car I have bought from him. He called me that afternoon and said it was great. I send him a check that day. I drove my wife's van to Gladewater from the Metroplex to get the car. Mike sat me in the seat of my Cruze (that looked brand new) and explained all the new features of the car. He kept my van to sell for me and got more than trade in value in two days. Why would I deal with anyone else? By the way it was full of gas and had brand new oil.

Thanks Mike Lambert.

Review: I am so pleased with my purchase from McKaig in Gladewater. Annette Preston is the Best! I showed up knowing what I wanted, then she walked me through every truck that had the criteria I listed. She was very friendly and patient with my three liitle ones as they climbed in and shopped with me. There was no pressure at all. I was upside down in my trade-in and worried about getting what I wanted within my budget. Floyd handled everything on the payment side and even worked things out to fit my budget! How awesome is that? 
Annette didn't stop once the sale was final though, that is why I recommend her to everyone I know!!!! Days later (yes I said days) a question would come up, all I had to do was pick up the phone and call. She still answered my questions!!!! Where in the world can you get service like that? I really appreciate her kindness and patience. Thank you!

Title: "McKaig Chevrolet Buick made my car buying experience very..."
Review: McKaig Chevrolet Buick made my car buying experience very easy and comfortable for me.  To begin, I used McKaig's website for my trade evaluation and their comparison tool, which I found both to be very useful.  Once I submitted a request, I received a phone call from Sabrina inviting me down to visit with Mike regarding a couple different vehicles.  During my visit, I found out that the sales team is non-commissioned and that gave me comfort that I would not be SOLD and would purchase the vehicle that I really wanted without being pressured.  McKaig really is a &quot;Dealer For the People&quot; and I would reccommend them to any of my friends and family.  I have purchased many vehicles and this was the best experience yet.  I will certainly be back in the future for any service needs.  Thank You to all of the Mckaig team.

Title: "I would recommend this dealership if you are considering..."
Review: I would recommend this dealership if you are considering purchasing a New or Used vehicle.  We purchased a New Tahoe and I could not ask for anything more than the quality of service we received.   From the moment we walked in the door until the papers were signed everyone was exceptional.  Mike Lambert was our salesman and he worked for us, not for him.  He worked hard to give us the best deal, and we appreciated it.   We have been to many car lots and have never encountered the exceptional service we received.   Sabrina was very kind and very informative, the guy we signed papers with was extremely explanatory and very kind.  The financial guy that was working that day helped us out even more than what we were expecting. (I apologize for not remembering your names).  they promised they would take care of us if we ever have any trouble, if they do not I will let you know.  Thank you everyone at McKaig we are very very happy.

We seen several people in there that day or I should say the 2 days we were there some wanting used vehicles and they too were treated with very kind and professional people.    

Thank you Mike Lambert for making this a great experience!!!!!

Title: "We were expecting McKaig to be like many dealerships,..."
Review: We were expecting McKaig to be like many dealerships, such as play games with the trade-in value of the old car vs. the price of the new car, etc.  So, we came poker-faced and ready to drive the 2.5 hours back home without a deal if necessary -- but it was overall a very pleasant experience. 

Stephen Pierson did a great job on selling what was, probably, the most expensive car on the lot!

Joshua Hoenshell worked out a great price on the car, and explained (and surprisingly remembered most the details of) the terms of the deal, even with the Chevrolet main computer being down. 

Having spoken with Sabrina first, she was very pleasant, informative and wasn't pushy, and was there for us when everything was wrapped up (after the computers were back online a few days later). 

So we'd gladly recommend McKaig for your next Chevrolet or Buick!

Also, Doyle is very good about helping me manage my time.  If a repair will take longer than 30 minutes, he lets me know up front so I can get a family member or friend to come and pick me up.  It is a plus that McKaig has now added free WiFi.  I can check e-mails with my netbook while I wait for my service job to be done.

Title: "Over the weekend while at our lake house our dash message..."
Review: Over the weekend while at our lake house our dash message came up "battery not charging." It was 8:00 on Friday night and we were about 30 mins from the house. My husband and 3 kids! Rathe than stop for dinner and turn the car off we went to the house. We got to the house and contacted Onstar.  They suggested that the car needed to be towed to the nearest dealership. The next morning we contacted our service rep at our dealership in Plano. He thought it was either the battery or alternator.  Upon calling Onstar again they were going to tow us to McKaig as the nearest dealership that was open on Saturday.  The problem was they were listed as open only until 1pm.  It was already 11:15. My husband called McKaig and was lucky enough to speak to Kent Abernathy in service.  After explaining that we were waiting on a tow and hoping he could work on us even if we weren't sure we'd be there by 1pm, Kent saved the day!  He offered to send one of his mechanics TO US!!  He sent Brian with a battery AND alternator, and then offered if he couldn't get it fixed, they would tow for us, and Scott could ride with Brian - Kent would set Scott up in a car and we could figure it out from there!!! Brian was there promptly and quickly discovered it was the alternator! As my girls said "Kent's our Hero"!!  By thinking outside the box and caring about our situation, he was able to limit the time we had to deal with this while we were supposed to be enjoying a weekend at the lake with our family!  Kent, with the help of Brian, went above and beyond in this situation for sure!!  We have told everyone about our amazing experience at the lake.  "You'll never guess what happened....."  HUGE thanks to Kent for going the extra mile and putting customer service and needs at the top of the priority list for a service customer.  Our Suburban is a 2003.....when we are ready to buy we will definately be calling McKaig!!  Many thanks to Kent and Brian for a job well done and saving the weekend at the lake with Daddy!

Review: we had purchased an 07 colorado about 1 yr ago and decided we wanted to go back to a full size crew cab truck. we drove over to gladewater after seeing an ad for a crew cab ford. mike showed it to us and also showed us an 07 silverado crew cab with lots less miles. we were very impressed with it, altho it hadnt been detailed yet. we decided it was more what we wanted and mike went to work on the financing and paperwork. we went to lunch and came back but there was a slight delay due to our request to change out the wheels to standard 17s instead of the 20s that were on it. mike solved the problem quickly and we drove out with a great truck at a great price sold to us by great people. we will return to mckaig in the future when we want to get the best deal on a truck.

I roamed the lot for days until I finally decided what I wanted. Never once did he take the "what is it going to take for me to get you into one today" approach. Josh worked through our financing and did an excellent job obtaining the best financing for us. This is a small town dealer with small town charm. As long as Phillip / Josh and crew are there, we will buy all of our vehicles from them.

Review: Our salesperson Roy was great from beginning to end.  He worked with us on selecting our vehicle to make sure we getting exactly the right model we wanted.  We had 2 of our 3 kids with us and we didn't want to put the car seat in the car to test drive.  Roy didn't mind letting us take turns test driving while the other of us stayed at the dealership with the toddler.  I felt he was very honest with us during the entire process.  I never felt like he was trying to be "slick" or talk us into something we didn't want.  Buying a car usually takes a few hours and I don't recommend taking your kids with you, but this day we didn't have a choice and we really wanted to buy a car that day.  By the end of the process, I will be honest...our kids were running wild!  Everyone there seemed understanding and even pitched in on entertaining them.  The finance manager, Josh, was wonderful in signing the papers.  By that time the kids were downright crazy.  Josh was thorough yet efficient in getting our papers signed.  He just chuckled as the kids drew on themselves w/ his desk pens.  (I don't normally let them do that, but that day whatever was entertaining to them was being allowed!)  We will be in the market for a car for my husband in a couple to a few years and we will definitely start our search at McKaig with Roy and Josh.  Thanks guys!

Review: We have been doing business with McKaig for over 20 years.  We have always been greeted with a smile and handsahke.  Mike is the best to work with.  No pressure when trying to make a purchase  in fact I just tell him what I want and if they don;t have the vehicle he will find it for me.  I absolutely love this dealership everyone makes you feel like you are family and call me by name everytime I am there.  Last year while working on our son;s senior prom I had a problem with my Suburban.  I went to get in it and it would not start needless to say I was in a panic as I knew I had to have that vehicle as we were moving decorations from where we assembled them to the prom location.  It was on a Saturday morning and I called McKaig and told them of my situation.  They said they would send a wrecker to pick up my vehicle, a few minutes later Mike called me back and said to not worry that Larry was bringing me anohter Suburban to use that week-end and they would have mine ready sometime Monday. I don't know of any other dealership that would have done that for me.  We have several family members that we have sent to buy there vehicles at McKaig we won't let them look at any other dealerships.  We are all very satisfied with customer service,Doyle and his staff in the service dept., Laura and the girls in the front office, and especailly to Mike for all that I put him through.  GREAT DEALERSHIP

Review: McKaig Chevroket is hands down the best dealership I have ever purchased a car from.  Their people know their business and we are not just another customer.  We are treated like family.  They certainly go above and beyond in customer service.  The last vehicle I purchased was from their lot.  I had looked at several others and was actually looking to purchase a different vehicle. They had the vehicle that I was looking to purchase and I was able to see what it looked like first hand inside.  I was not happy with the color scheme when I looked at it and found the car I decided I really wanted on their lot.  They had located vehicles that I was looking for but ultimately I decided on a vehicle that was right at home.  We have purchased three vehicles from them within the past few years and will continue to do so in the future.  They are very competitive on new car values as well as trade-in values.  They are an all around excellent dealership that I recommend to anyone buying a car.  Their service team is also outstanding as well.  Doyle knows everyone by name, knows what they need to have done to their cars, and accomodates his customers.  His technicians are top-notch.  We have purchased cars through Kent Abernathy, Larry Abernathy, and Philip Anderson and have been more than pleased with their efforts in making us happy with our automobile.  The girls in the office are great as well.  THey know their customers and they know their business.  All I have to do is walk in the door and everybody is willing to help me.  They are all very personable people.  I actually enjoy going into the dealership just to see my friends at McKaig Chevrolet.

I knew the make and model I wanted and found a car that seemed to match my criteria on the McKaig website. The internet sales lady, Kat, was really helpful and we arranged to go and take a test drive. The car was ready and waiting for us when we got there, pulled up under cover next to the door as it was pouring with rain. The car was exactly as described. Charles Phillips looked after my sale and after the test drive, we agreed the purchase without any pressure. Charles, Sabrina and the rest of the team made the whole transaction a really easy and friendly experience. I would recommend anyone who finds car-buying stressful to go there. They were awesome!

It was a Sunday before Christmas so all we could do was leave it.  The next morning we returned to the car and walked into the dealership.  They were very prompt in starting to solve the problem.  Shannon Wheeler kept us informed on everything they did and when he realized they might have to replace the engine he gave us a courtesy vehicle that was the most comparable to ours.  Every person we came in contact with was so friendly and personable. I would have to say that if your car is going to quit this was the best place to have it happen beside.

Title: "One of the best places to buy a Vehicle"
Review: My husband and I just bought our third vehicle this afternoon, a 2015 Chevy Traverse. The commitment to customer service and getting you in a new vehicle is outstanding, Our salesman Mike Lambert is one of the best! His award winning smile and ability to make you feel like a friends is top notch. We will not go any where else, We also know from experience that their service department is second to NONE! That Mr Dole is always willing to help and tell you what any problem is and get you in and out as soon as possible. Great team here at this dealership!  The whole staff down there is friendly and have you feeling like you are at home immediately! Way to go McKaig! What a great business and we intend to be doing business here for quite a while! You have our vote!  Mike and Belinda Wragg

Review: Well I came to McKaig Chevrolet out of pure coincidence. I went not expecting to qualify for anything,new or used. But by the grace of God and the few people I met, I was approved a new 2013 Chevy Sonic! I first spoke with Ms. Faye over the phone and her kind demeanor, hooked me in. I then spoke with Mr Brian Pilcher, who then gathered all my information. After perhaps and hour or so, Mr Jeriamy Schumacher, came out to greet and congratulate me on this new car! I can not begin to thank this group of people enough! I am sure I was near a breakdown with my old car that was on its last leg! Thank you McKaig and MANY thanks to those that helped me at this time. They even stayed later, after hours, just to help me get settled in and comfortable with this new ride. Excellent team work and fantastic customer service!

Review: My wife and I went to McKaig Chevrolet in Gladewater to look at purchasing a replacement vehicle for our truck.  We were intially met by our salesman Brian, who was extremely helpful and patient in our process for selecting a good truck to fit our wants and needs.  He let us test drive several vehicles, and pointed out different features, and the benefits of one over the other.  We eventually decided on a new 2013 silverado.  As we got more into the deal, we met Josh the sales manager, who helped us get the deal rolling.  Josh contacted a vehicle wholesaler to get use the most money for our trade.  He gave us some intial figures, and from there we were able to start the negotiating process.  Once we decided that we were intent on purchasing our truck, we met Jeriamy, our finance specialist.  Jeriamy got us financed at a rate, term, and payment that we could afford.  Dealing with him through the &quot;hard&quot; part with financing made the whole experience a breeze.  Never once did I feel pressured during the whole experience.  Everyone was extremely patient and friendly.  I felt like a part of the family.  All three guys stayed untill 8pm (sorry fellas) to get my deal finalized.  With McKaig Chevrolet, I never felt like a sales figure.  They earned a customer for life!

Being located 3.5 hours away, we relied heavily on their good word that the vehicle I was interested in was in perfect shape. After several phone calls, emails, and texts back and forth, they got the numbers right and we made the drive from Beaumont to Gladewater the same day! They worked an AWESOME car deal for us in just one day! Not only did they make it happen quickly, but they gave me top dollar on my trade-in, worked with us on financing, provided a quality vehicle, and stayed late to ensure that we were well taken care of. This place was definitely worth the drive! I brought my dream car home the same day as I found it thanks to Charles, who worked a great deal for us, and Sabrina, who played the number game and made it all happen within our budget! And that funny man Johnny even made a good joke or two along the way! We were treated like great friends, and felt informed and confident in our purchase the entire time.

I didn't even buy my car there but anything I've needed done to it Mckaig went over and beyond even if they didn't have the part, they got it in hours not days. Then they take time to call to make sure you are please with the work they have done or to see if it is to your liking. I'm sure everyone is very professional and top notch but I've had the pleasure of dealing with Shannon the times I've been there so please call him with your car needs. You will be in great hands.

Title: "Best sale experience ever"
Review: First of all giving all praises to God. See on 2/19/16, I wasn't going to buy a car, at less that's what I kept telling myself and my sales man Brian F. Pilcher. I told Brian I'm just coming to do a information day and to see where I stand, and to test drive a 2015 Chevy Impala, he said ok. We sit and talked and laugh, like we have been knowing each other 4ever. It wasn't like I was buying a new car, he wasn't pushing no sale on me, he was getting to know me and I was gaining a new friend. Brian made it very easy for me, we crunch some numbers 2gether to see where I wanted my note to be, view my options, we did all of that &amp; then some &amp; after that we went in 4 the kill. Let's just say we both came out on top. He made me very happy and I hope I made his experience very pleasant too. I am a very proud owner of a brand new 2015 Chevy Impala 2Lt. Thank you Brian for my wonderful experience. Keep up the great work. Who ever is looking for a stress free environment, to buy a car, or to window shop, etc go see my dream team @ McKaig in Gladewater, Texas.

Mike and Jeremy got me into a quality car with low miles and a good price on payments with a warranty that is great merry Christmas to me.  If u need a good car then I highly recommend this dealer.  If anyone can do it they can my credit score sucks and they looked past that.  Love these people they went above and beyond what I expected.  Thanks yall

He was not pushy, didn't force us to run a credit check to see where we were, and he got us into a vehicle that best suited our needs!

Title: "Pleasant experience"
Review: I found McKaig Chevrolet on Facebook of all places.  I reached out to Adrian Cortes via Facebook to schedule an appointment to meet with him.  I was nervous about meeting with him because our prior car dealership experiences were awful.  As soon as we walked in the door we were welcomed by friendly staff members.  Adrian listened to our current situation and explained what options were available to us.  He kept us in the loop of what was going on through text messages.  He found us the vehicle that we were looking for at a very fair price.  Adrian was super friendly and knowledgeable.  We had to leave and return later on that evening to finish the paperwork.  It was after closing time for them and they still invited us to return and get everything in order.  I really appreciate Adrian and Sabrina staying after hours to take care of us...they went ABOVE and BEYOND!   The hug and &quot;Welcome to the family&quot; from Sabrina sealed the deal for us being long term customers.  We left McKaig knowing that they care about us as a customer.  I definitely recommend McKaig Chevrolet and Adrian Cortes to friends and family.  Great experience from beginning to end!

Review: One of our crews were traveling from Dallas to Longview, Texas to do a time sensitive project for one of our customers.  The transmission went out on our van and left the crew stranded on the side of the road with our 16' cargo trailer.  My office made one phone call to Shannon Wheeler and his team at McKaig Chevrolet Buick and within an hour we were in a rental vehicle with trailer in tow to our final destination.  Shannon and his team had our van in the shop immediately and started the process of determining warranty and installation time.  Within 7 days we had our van back with a new transmission .  Amazing customer service!  I would recommend McKaig Chevrolet Buick to anyone.

They listened to what I was wanting in a car and provided.  I am so happy with my purchase and will definitely buy all my vehicles from here from now on.  Kent introduced me to all the service technicians and explained how to get my oil changed and everything.  His son, Aaron, even set up my bluetooth so it would connect to my phone - he was so polite and helpful! Doyle even came out to meet me and give me his phone number because he has been servicing my grandmother's vehicle since I was a little girl.  Bruce was so nice and patient with explaining all the new technology in my car!  He even helped me install my carseat!!  He even checked in with me a few days later to make sure I was figuring everything out.  You just can't get service like this anymore.  I could not have asked for a better experience.

He even took care of payment so I could just pick up my car and go ! Aaron demonstrated that you are a dealer for the people !!! I appreciate Aaron for owning the situation and resolving the issue .

Review: I am very pleased to say that I loved working with Sabrina more than anything. I would not have worked with any one else but her. I love the team work that Sabrina and Floyd and whom ever else that stepped in to help get me into the car I wanted. I want to say thank you to all of them but more so Sabrina because she was a fighter and she didn't give up on me when I was ready to give up on her. The reason why I was ready to give up was because I was promised by other dealers that I have worked with in the past what they was going to do for me and Randy but never came thru for us. But she did and I love to have someone like her and the rest of the team in my corner any day because they fight for there customers. A love her drive because she was at work the next day when she found that Randy was looking to get into another car. She told him to hold off until 6 months but the next day she texted me and said that she was working on something for him and she was off that day at home working for us. Not to many people will answer there phones on there off day for customers or work from home on there off day. But thats what I love about Sabrina and that day I had told Randy you got the car and he said to me how do you know. I told him because we have Sabrina in our corner and she is a fighter. How i know because she fought for me and i know that she will do the same for you. And just like i said she texted me a few hours latter saying what time can you guys get her and i knew it was a done deal. Thanks for the best experience of our lives dealing with a car dealership. We will come back as long as we don't move. You all have made us feel like family.

Review: My husband and I filled out request online for car dealerships in our area. The only one that responded to all those request was was McKaig Chevrolet. Faye Hinds called me first and then emailed me to find out what I was looking for. I explained to her it would be after Christmas before I bought a car, so we set up an appointment. Over the past several months I have had appointments but many were canceled due to unforeseen circumstances. Faye always kept in touch to see if I was okay, over the past months she has become a friend. I finally got to meet her on Friday April 18, 2014. Faye you are a blessing. I called Faye and told her I was on my way and she had Brian waiting for me. Brian asked what I was looking for and how much I wanted to spend. He knew just the vehicle. I am a proud owner of a 2010 HHR.


Thanks so much, you guys are wonderful. Have a blessed week!!!

Don't let your past &quot;typically awful&quot; experiences with car lots stop you from getting something newer...but you'll only find this degree of kindness, patience, and honesty at McKaig Chevy Buick. I'm ALWAYS reading reviews on everything I buy...from boxers to tools to cars! But, I rarely take the time (sadly) to do the reviews myself! However, I am so impressed with McKaig, their &quot;non-commissioned&quot; sales force, their devotion to their community and individually to Christ. There are some mighty fine folks there such as Sabrina Preiss and her &quot;email&quot; patience (THANK YOU!); the coolest and most laid back salesman anyone could ask for, Brian &quot;Laid To Rest&quot; Pilcher (THANK YOU &amp; thank you for staying so late to help my wife and I find exactly what we each wanted as well as your patience with us while trying to find our two SUV's); and a big thanks to both Jeriamy &quot;Mr Fuel Efficient&quot; Schumacher and Floyd &quot;Fit Hockey Fan&quot; Rucks (THANK YOU &amp; thank you for patiently doing DOUBLE paperwork so late in the evening).

In short, after working with them for some time before we made the short drive from Brownsboro...and after our experience with Brian and McKaig, I have committed to never deal with another car dealer in the future. I highly recommend McKaig and have already done so...and often!

Review: I &quot;highly recommend&quot; the folks at McKaig Chevrolet.  My family has done business with Mckaig Chevrolet for over 50 years and I would not consider purchasing a Chevrolet from any other dealer.  From Kent Abernathy to Aaron Abernathy to Doyle Dougan to any other employee of this dealership, the service is some of the best I've ever experienced.  I service a business with over 3000 customers myself and would be excited to have the caliber of employees at my company that McKaig has at thiers.  These folks without a doubt understand what it means to provide &quot;world-class&quot; service to customers.  I have traveled many places over the years and have witnessed a ton of businesses TRY to perform at a level that promotes both growth and profitability but rarely do I see businesses that can be successful at both and at the same time preserve the &quot;customer experience&quot; that brings about customer retainage which is what any good business owner knows &quot;makes things last&quot;.  These guys have mastered the art of providing &quot;BIG TIME SERVICE AND PROFESSIONALISM&quot; while keeping in tact the very values that their dealership was built on.......I know because I was there then and will continue to be there now.  Kudos to McKaig Chevrolet for absolutely being a &quot;Dealer For The People&quot;.

Everyone worked very hard! I like that there was a waiting room with tv and complimentary drinks, and even reimbursed us for our lunch! Everyone we spoke with was friendly! Mike took the time to get to know us and even helped us clean out our trade in vehicle! He was great! Also enjoyed doing paperwork with Jeriamy Schumacher. We talked with him for a while! I think both those men took to heart &quot;dealer for the people&quot;. All in all, great experience, friendly staff, and we were able to get in the vehicle we wanted!

Title: "I had been to another dealership the day before I visited..."
Review: I had been to another dealership the day before I visited McKaig, and the experience was so horrible that I considered giving up on purchasing a new car. Faye contacted me the next day and assured me that the McKaig experience would be completely different. I had researched car pricing online and found that McKaig ha the best prices in the area, so I decided to give it one more try. 
From the moment I walked in the door, I was greeted and set up with Mike Lambert in sales. Mike had excellent customer service skills and was so easy to work with. He didn't try to talk me into a more expensive car, he simply wanted me to get what I wanted. McKaig had the exact vehicle I was looking for in stock, and it was priced thousands below other dealerships. 
My credit wasn't in the best of shape, and I was worried about financing, and that's where Jeriamy came in. He is excellent at what he does, and it seems they have a great reputation with the lenders because Jeriamy was able to get me financed for the vehicle in no time at all. I felt no judgement from them on my credit history and their attitude was &quot;let's get you financed and help you get your credit back on the road again.&quot; 
Floyd walked me through signing all the paperwork that comes with purchasing a car. He explained everything in a way that was easy to understand and never got impatient when I had questions.
Faye and even sales specialists that were not involved in the sale constantly made sure I was comfortable and had something to drink.
At the end o the sale, Mike did not just hand me paperwork instructions on setting up my onstar and Bluetooth in my new vehicle. He actually sat in the car with me and called onstar with me to set up my account and went through every function on the vehicle to make sure I knew how to use them so that I could enjoy my new vehicle  to the fullest. 
I have never encountered such a wonderful experience in buying a car. From walking in the door, to driving off the lot in my new car was such a short time span and never unenjoyable. I will never, ever go anywhere to buy a car again! 
If you are considering purchasing a car, do yourself a favor and go by McKaig first. Chances are, you'll never have to go visit another dealership!

I called this morning and Doyle told me to bring my car in. He hooked it up to the computer, assured me there was no major problem and it would be safe to drive.  He reset the engine light and told me if it came on again this weekend to bring it in Monday morning and he would fix it. He thought it would most likely be plug wires.
I can't tell you how much I appreciate his honesty, kindness and the peace of mind he gave me.

Review: Having been to several car dealerships in our lifetime, we would rate our experience with McKaig Chevrolet as unusually positive.  The sales experience with Brent was informative and un-pressured as we went thru our various options.  Brent and Josh were very patient thru our NUMEROUS questions and brainstorming.  Also notable was that everyone we dealt with had lunch on the table, but delayed eating for over two hours, until all of our purchasing formalities were done and we were off the lot with the car.

McKaig had us bring the vehicle back two days later, on Monday, where they proceeded to finalize any of the servicing that was necessary, such as alignment, cleaning, and fuse replacement.  Doyle and Jimmy were very thorough in their details.

Hands-down, best vehicle experience ever!

Review: We have bought a lot of cars through the years. We have never had such a positive experience like we did at McKaig. Everyone there was kind and helpful. Our sales representative, Philip Anderson, was absolutely the best we have ever dealt with. I must say we have always felt like the sales reps we had before would have said anything to get us to buy something even if it wasn't true. We have definately had some bad experiences in the past. However, we knew Philip wanted to do what was best for us and he was very helpful without being pushy. He made us feel very comfortable with such an important decision. We have told numerous people that when they are looking to buy a car or truck that they need to go to McKaig and ask for Philip Anderson. We will definately be a repeat customer.

However, we would shop at McKaig's even if we didn't live in Gladewater because of the outstanding service before, during and after the sale.  We feel we've always received a good deal on purchases and gotten prompt, courteous and outstanding service from the service department.  Years ago, when we were young and stupid, we purchased a new vehicle from a huge "volume" dealer in a much larger city.  The whole experience was a nightmare from beginning to end.  We vowed then to never make the same mistake, and we haven't.  We've purchased new and used vehicles and even used their service department on a car we inherited.  Every experience has been a pleasant one.  We'd never go anywhere else.

When we returned to the dealership, I ask him what kind of payments would it be and the range sounded like something I could afford. He took my info and came back with payments that were very reasonable. I decided to buy the truck, so while I was filling out paper work and doing all those things , he was getting it wash and took it and put gas in it for me. I really like the friendly way things were done, not like most car dealers that are pushing to make a sale no matter what. I will most defiantly be recommending this dealership and Adrian Cortes.

Not having picture perfect credit because &quot;life happens and not always the way we planned&quot; I had listened to the radio advertisements and hating being disappointed and turned away decided to check out McKaig Chevrolet.....SO HAPPY that I did! I was able to browse the lot and look at the vehicles that I was interested in, Greeted by Adrian Cortes, he was polite, knowledgeable of each vehicle I questioned him about, willingly encouraged the  test drive and laughed at my nervous energy and sarcastic jokes. He has a great sense of humor as well. His professionalism and knowledge base was awesome. I did not feel any high pressure sales pitches from him, he wanted to make sure that I was comfortable and certain about the vehicle that I chose.  During the entire process he was accommodating with information and I felt that he was straight forward, honest and had my best interest in mind. I would definitely shop here again and highly recommend that you ask for Adrian to assist you in you next car buying venture.

Review: Like most folks, I don't buy a vehicle very often. The process of making a myriad of choices is pretty daunting.  We looked at several dealers but were unable to find the combination of price and features we wanted. We found just the right SUV at McKaig.  Charles Phillips worked with us over the course of several days. He is knowledgeable and polite, very low key. He made a daunting task so much easier and ultimately helped put us in a Chevrolet Equinox. Sabrina filled us in on all the warranty details and somehow made us laugh in the process. Boring made funny, go figure.  Larry Jones answered several service related questions for us that helped us understand the McKaig way of taking care of customers. Overall, such a positive experience that I can recommend McKaig to anyone looking for a vehicle. Their offer of free oil changes for life is the icing on the cake. Like the old saying, happy wife, happy life-she loves her new car! Thanks Charles, Sabrina, and Larry.

Sabrina also made the financing side of my purchase very easy. Everyone in the building was very friendly.  This is the 5th vehicle that i have purchased from McKaig,, why go anywhere else.

Review: The experience I had today was so great!!!!! Although I wasn't searching for a car I took a friend there who was. This young man by the name of Adrian Cortes greeted us at the door and things took off from there. He was very attentive and listened to all the needs which was in play. This guy delivered above, and beyond expectations. The entire staff was very friendly and welcoming. My good friend walk away with a car she didn't expect to get with tears of Joy. Thanks to the entire company especially AdrianAdrian. The experience I left with made me feel like I purchased a new car. I'm for certain where I'm going when it's time for my upgrade ,and that's McKaig a dealership for the people. They mean just that!

Title: "Really Didn&#39;t Think It Would Happen"
Review: So I hear the McKaig Chevrolet commercials on the radio all the time. I have visited the website a couple of times. I was looking around for a more economical vehicle, and Rick, in the internet department, reached out and indicated they might be able to help. I explained my situation, and made an appointment to meet with Bruce (Sales). After looking at a couple of vehicles and settling on one, we worked on getting the deal done. I left without a car that first evening. Bruce and Jeremy continued to work to get the deal done, and four days later I drove away in my new (used) vehicle. It will probably save me close to $300 in fuel a month. The team bent over backwards to get me where I needed to be financially. When I did the paperwork for the vehicle, Sabrina explained everything in layman terms and I walked away feeling pretty darn good! Thanks Guys and Gal!

Review: I'd like to begin by saying that I am in the sales business and was determined that I would not be handled or persuaded to do anything because I hate that feeling like your being &quot;pushed&quot; around....&amp; I most definitely wasn't!!! Bruce was the most genuine and sincere salesman I've spoken with. He was very professional and eager to assist me.....not to sell me. Paul was a great guy full of personality and Mrs. Sabrina was very friendly and ingormative. This was; hands down, my best buying experience and we will continue to enjoy their hospitality and family approach to business from now on. Thank you for everything and we look forward to our next purchase from you.

Review: I bought my first car at McKaigs and have returned for all my service appointments. The staff is friendly, accommodating and unintimidating to women (important to a 23 year old, single, financially independent woman). They explain everything thoroughly and I always feel like I'm getting excellent service and a fair price. That's why I bought my second car there too. Mike, in the sales department, was incredible. Although they didn't have the car I wanted on the lot, he was tireless in finding exactly what I wanted and getting it down to my price range. He made the process seamless for me and that's why I'll be returning for all my future service as well as buying my next car there too. Thanks again McKaigs!

Title: "CUSTOMER SERVICE ALWAYS EXCELLENT"
Review: Came in with no appt. to get oil changed. When I was walking up to customer service desk I was greeted by Doyle and a young man that was working in the shop. Went to check in with Shannon and he looked to see how fast they could get to my oil change. I was there probably less than 20-30 minutes. While waiting in the waiting area another young man came out of an office to offer me a drink. I walked to the show room to get reading material and a salesman got up from his desk to help me find brochures for Traverse and Suburbans.  Shannon came to let me know my car was ready and explained the extra touches they did such as filling wiper fluid etc. I think he called it a 52 point check. When paying for service the lady that took my payment was very friendly and acted happy to be there. I have had oil changed at other dealerships but never at one where I felt like they were there to be happy to help and make sure I felt like it was a pleasure to be there. A GREAT EXPERIENCE!

Title: "Least stressful car buy experience ever!!!!!!!"
Review: This was my biggest vehicle purchase.   I have purchased MANY new cars in my life. Each experience has been different in its own way. This one has beat them all.  I automatically have a bad attitude when it comes to buying a vehicle  (because I think all of the employees they are all &quot;out to get me or my money&quot;) from the test drive until the deal was done I put this guy through a lot.  He went beyond anything I could have imagined to get me what I wanted to be happy.  I could go on and on but I'll just say this, it takes a lot to make me happy and to want to share my positive experience and I have to say this has been the best purchase ever!!!!! 
Everyone was very friendly and not pushy from the first time I walked in the door.

Review: I have been going here for all my vehicle maintenance for a few years now but when I heard about the $5.00 down on the first (88) cars to go on the lot it triggered my interest in getting a newer ride. I didn't want to sit around the dealership for hours on end to see if I even qualified so I got a hold of one of the sales staff, Brian Pilcher, and informed him that I wanted to do all the paperwork online as I had little to no time between work and picking up my son. I was very happy with the help that I received and actual time it took to get approved. I only went in twice in two days and spent a maximum of (1) hour each time to finish up the in-house paperwork. That was soo much easier than the 4-6 hours I've spent at other places. It was very painless and the staff was super friendly. I'm sure I got offered at least 12 bottles of water in the time I was there. lol. My credit is poor-average but that was not an issue at all. I have got to say that I would refer anyone and everyone here to get there &quot;Nicer, newer car!&quot; lol

Review: McKaig Chevrolet has been loyal to my family for as long as I can remember and in return my family has been loyal to them.  Their service is quick and the quality of work is superb.  I recently bought a new vehicle from them and the power steering went out twice within a couple of months of purchasing the vehicle. On the first occasion, I was about 120 miles from them and they arranged for a tow truck and for a dealership in the town I was in to service the problem and due to some convincing by McKaig's, I recieved my vehicle the next day.  A couple of weeks later, the power steering went out again and again I was out of town.  Once again, McKaig's arranged a tow truck and instead had the vehicle towed back to their service department. I haven't had a problem since.  I don't know any other dealership that would go to those lengths to help a customer out.  Having seen their loyalty first hand, I will never purchase a vehicle from another dealership.

Review: My experience with McKaig Chevrolet will always be remember as one of the greatest  moments  for looking for a vehicle.  From start to finish everyone was so helpful, friendly, Professional staff. All had made my experience a  very lasting impression.  No pressure,  non pushy and most of all willing to help see me get into a vehicle.  With me having some financial obstacles reflecting they went out of the way to find a lender that would work with me and my current situation and the results paid off. not only did I get approve,  but  I drove home in a brand new 2017  vehicle.  So if there  is hope for me  there is definitely hope for the  next person that is in need of a vehicle.  Don't let that stand in your way  Thanks Jason for helping me I appreciate you and I intend to purchase my next vehicle here as well.

Title: "Freaking Amazing "
Review: So, my husband and I got hit hard when the oilfield crashed and so did our credit.  My husband needed a vehicle of his own recently as he has a job out of town so we went into McKaig knowing in our minds that we wouldn't get approved for a car but we needed to try.  Adrian walked out to us at one of the trucks we were looking at and asked if we wanted to test drive the truck.  We told him that we probably wouldn't get approved and Adrian encouraged us that he could get us in a truck.  The deal started to get a little complicated and my husband was ready to back out and Adrian text me and said hey I'm taking care of this and this please come up here, see me and let's get you to sign papers.  Two days going above and beyond his job he got us a vehicle.

Title: "Going the extra mile! "
Review: I had been looking for a new car for several months and had been turned away at every dealership I talked to. I had been to every dealership in Kilgore, Texas, where I live, and an acquaintance recommended McKaig in Gladewater. I made an appointment, and met with Mike Lambert. He was very patient with me, and took my situation into consideration. After receiving an offer that was out of my price range, I told him I would keep my car and try again once my situation changed. He understood, and I left, thinking that there was no way I could get a new car. Before I made it home that afternoon, I got a call from Sabrina at McKaig, with another, better offer. It was still out of my price range, and she assured me that they would meet my price point. The next day, Mike called me with great news. They had secured financing for me with a payment less than my original price point and at an interest rate that was less than half of what I was currently paying. The car they found for me was brand new! When I went in to sign the paperwork on my brand new car, the finance manager, Jeriamy, was on the phone with the bank, still working to get me the best deal possible. I have never been taken care of anywhere the way Mike, Sabrina, and Jeriamy took care of me at McKaig. I will be a repeat customer at their dealership, and am loving my brand new, 2016 Chevy Cruze!

Review: My Husband and I walked into McKaig with our two year old daughter Saturday the fourteenth of May, already thinking to myself &quot;here we go with the denial speech, but at least we know&quot;. As we walked in Mike Lambert approach us eager to help us in anyway he could, I thought this is their catch super excited about a young family coming in so they could eat us alive. BUT I was WRONG, DEAD WRONG from the beginning. Mike was the absolute BEST we could have encountered. Jeriamy and Mike worked magic I tell you on getting a deal for my husband and I. They were so patient and kind with our situation and worked a deal that I was never aware a dealership could do! They made so many things just EASY, I was even blown away as to how the staff and especially Mike handled and interacted with our two year old; I do believe she was trying to take Mikes place with all the cuteness she was displaying. We also sat with Sabrina, whom as well was very caring towards our wild two year old at that point, she was precise and attentive to our questions and our concerns when going through the paperwork and IM TELLING YOU PEOPLE, SABRINA WEATHERED THE STORM from what our two year old did in her diaper with the door closed in her office. BUT ALL IN ALL I WAS EXTREMELY IMPRESSED!! Walked into McKaig with a Debbie downer attitude and walked out as positive Polly! May God bless each and every single one of the staff members there at McKaig, they truly are a pleasure to do business with.

Aaron has worked very hard to become an outstanding leader in the service department at McKaigs. I came to him with questions concerning a particular issue. He showed genuine interest and concern, went out and looked at the problem and assured me he would check on warranty coverage and get back with me.

I took it to McKaig and Shannon Wheeler found the problem and fixed it for me.I am beyond pleased and impressed with the service I received from  Shannon and the service department. The customer service I received has restored my faith in GM and their products. I would highly recommend McKaig to anyone car shopping.

They were very busy but said to bring it over and they would try to work me in but it may be until Mon morning before they could get to it.  Shannon met me and after hearing my need for repair, agreed to look at my car to see what was needed.  They were able to fix it and was able to meet my commitments.  Thanks so much for your caring supportive staff.  It means so much to me to know i can count on you when I need service.  I recommend your dealership to everyone.

Mike Lambert has always been our Go To salesman. He found the Equinox that we wanted the same day. We drove it home the next day. McKaig Chevrolet staff will work with you to get what you want. With any maintenance and repairs on any vehicle we bought there, Doyle Dougan has always been there for us. Great friends and great service. Highly recommend!

Review: so I stopped at a convenience store across the street from mckaig for a cup of coffee on a Saturday morning . the store didn't have any fresh coffee , only several containers with an inch or two of hot mud . walked across street to dealer since I was pretty sure they could give me a fresh cup of coffee if I looked around on their lot and chatted with a sales rep . It worked and I got a free cup of fresh coffee . I then decided to purchase a 2010 equinox while I was there and drove it home a little over an hour later . also got another cup of coffee for the road . c.t.walker helped to stay within the downpayment and monthly payment I was going to be comfortable with . had a very good experience overall and would recommend others to visit the dealer and give them a chance to work with you on a new or used vehicle .

Their price is better than Tyler prices, but most of all their character is that of people who understand their customers, truly care for their customers, and will do what it takes to put the customer first. You feel like a friend rather than a number and can rest assured that you got professional maintenance. I would refer them to anyone, even if it means driving an extra 45 minutes.

Review: My initial contact with McKaig was through their website.  Followup emails with Faye were helpful and indicated their interest in me being a customer.  Ultimately we visited McKaig and purchased a Buick Enclave from Mike Lambert.   Mike was very friendly and knowledgeable of the vehicle's features.   He clearly explained the purchase documents and showed us how to use the various features on the car after the sale. Based on internet searches I think I might have gotten a slightly better price from a Dallas dealership but overall the price of the vehicle and the trade allowance for my vehicle were good and I prefer to buy from local dealerships when possible.  We did not finance the vehicle through McKaig but their finance people provided a very competitive financing proposal.   We accidentally left CD's in the player of our old vehicle and they went the exra mile to retrieve the CD's from the car wholesaler who bought the car and return them to us.  I would definitely recommend McKaig to others and will consider them when I purchase my next vehicle.

MY husband and I really needed a car. Our current car was old and not able to transport my family back and forth. We heard the commercial on the radio and didn’t know what to expect because we have been turned down by other dealerships. As soon as walked in, we felted appreciated; because they work miracles with our credit. Our sales person was Annette Preston and she made us feel welcome showed my husband his options. Not only do they help you get a car they talk to you about to maintain and reduce your credit. We went from a 2007 minivan to a 2013 Suv. It felt so good to drive off with a car we like and with a payment we can afford. The Initial plan was we would just window shop because, everyone has turn us down. However, they got in a particular new car with NO MONEY DOWN!! What a great way to bring in the New Year. WE ARE McKaig CUSTOMER FOR LIFE, THANKS TO ANNETTE PRESTON.

Thank you McKaig for everything and hiring great people who genuine and honest.

Title: "My experience with McKaig began when I heard the..."
Review: My experience with McKaig began when I heard the commercial on the radio with a slogan, “A dealer for the people.”  Well at that point I didn’t know if that was true or not but I was in the market for a nicer, newer car with better gas mileage and a lower car payment.  I first went to the dealership on a late Saturday afternoon.  They were closed at the time, but we were warmly greeted by one of their solution specialist Annette Preston, who happened to be there.  She quickly surveyed what we were looking for and what we needed to fit our budget.  We exchanged numbers and agreed to touch base on Monday.  I test drove a vehicle on Monday afternoon, but it didn’t seem to fit what I was looking for.  She was committed to finding something that would work for us.  I never felt pressured or haggled at all.    At the end of that week, I set up another appointment to test drive another car on Saturday.  She happened to be out that day but she made sure that I would be taken well care of.  I met, Floyd Rucks, on Saturday, when I showed up to test drive the second car.  I took it for a test drive and really liked it and thought it would fit better in my price range.  Floyd shocked me when he offered to let me take it home for the weekend.  He was very nice about not making me feel guilty for taking it home, even if I decided not to get it.  It was this trust from the staff that made all the difference for me.  On Monday, I took no time letting Annette know this was the car for me.  I was very specific about what I wanted in my trade in and where I wanted my payments to be.  They quickly went to work to get the job done.  I was more than thrilled with Annette, Floyd, and Jeremy’s hard work, determination, and patience to help me get exactly what I wanted and needed.  Their no pressure attitude, non-haggling, and ultimately listening to what I was looking was important to me.  I will definitely be back here for all my future car purchases.  I can honestly say their slogan, “A dealer for the people”, is 100% true!  I’ve been to the big dealers before and my car buying experience has never been this laid back, or easy.  Truly amazing and overwhelming satisfied.  Thanks McKaig!!!

Mike Lambert was our primary salesman, but others answered phone calls from us and were also friendly.  We discussed our needs and price range.  Having a daughter with special needs and choosing a vehicle to meet her needs was our primary goal.  Mike was very understanding of this.  He willingly moved vehicles next to our van in order for us to easily transfer her into a vehicle of interest.  We weren't showed vehicles out of our price range or that weren't going to meet our needs.  Once the Titan arrived on the lot, we were very excited.  Mike worked with us in doing alot of the work over the phone so we wouldn't have to take off work or spend alot of time at the dealership.  The financing process was quick and easy.  I would highly recommend this dealership to my friends and family.

Review: Brian was absolutely wonderful during the entire process of buying a car! He was informative, invigorating and intelligent in his thorough knowledge of the dealership and the car itself. Not to mention that my father and I drove into the dealership with another dealers car and McKaig Chevrolet remained unthreatened! In fact, just the opposite occurred. Joshua took on the challenge of making a better deal for their particular car than the other company had previously offered. Brian and Joshua worked as a team to make the entire experience easy and laid-back. Joshua worked with my father and I on a set price and never faltered in trying to find us the perfect deal. Finally, we were able to sit down with Jeriamy and not only deal with the business side of the deal, but also tell stories of our families! Jeriamy truly showed an interest in our background and he understood that this was my first car buy and made me feel confident about it! Not only were all three gentlemen welcoming, but also offered any assistance at any time it was needed. Brian, Joshua and Jeriamy made my first car-buying experience perfect and I really would recommend this dealership to anyone who asked!!!

I recommend McKaig for both purchasing a new vehicle and auto services. Thank you team members at McKaig Chevrolet!

Review: McKaig Chevolet has been a member of my &quot;family&quot; since I was a child so when I need a new car that's where I go. I needed a new car so, I stopped by and Phillip met me at the door and found me a car that &quot;fit&quot; me and I took it home and am a happy camper. I know if I have any problems they're only a phone call away and everyone is VERY patient with me in explaining how all the buttons work (I don't understand all the electronic gadgets very well). I love the &quot;hometown&quot; -call you by your first name - how are the kids doing - friendly service you get at McKaig's. You just don't get that kind of service at a big dealership and that's why I keep going back &quot;home&quot; to buy my vehicles. And I recommend them to my friends.

Review: My husband has always been a chevy man. So I decided to search all available vehicles.
We live in Harleton, I work in Kilgore. I have a very long day with my commute. We were looking for great mileage as well as comfort. I'm short, he's tall. I've driven a truck for about 15 years. We came to a happy medium once we looked at the suv's. As soon as we saw the Mocha Steel Equinox we fell for it. He knew I loved this color so much that he searched all area dealers. My son, suggested McKaig because a long time friend always traded with them. On arrival, my husband was NUTS! He couldn't wait for the afternoon for me to see it. He said it was more beautiful than he imagined. I've only had 1 new vehicle my whole life, so far and this one is AWESOME!!! They guys made everything simple, but fast. I can definitely see us returning in a few years to buy my husband a new truck.

Review: I went to McKaig after having my tires rotated at another business...BIG MISTAKE!! I should have gone to McKaig FIRST. The other business lost the cap on one of my tires and then over inflated them. I went to McKaig to purchase a new cap for my tire and asked about the over inflation (the monitor in my car showed too much air). When I told them what I had done they went right to work and fixed everything. They were the nicest people you could ask for. They were EXCELLENT in every way possible. I was so pleased with the way I was treated EVEN though I had gone somewhere else first, that I will return there everytime I need anything from oil changes to the rotation of tires to purchasing a vehicle. I can't say enough about how nice everyone was.

Review: I have been involved with Mckaig Chevrolet for eight years. Whether purchasing a car, which there has been four over the last six years, or getting service work done on our vehicles, I and my family have had nothing but good experiences with all the people that make up the Mckaig family.  I am the father of three girls, my wife makes four women in my house hold. It goes without saying the staff of Mckaig Chevrolet takes the worries from me if any of my girls have to go there for anything, whether its service work or just to ask a question about their vehicle. They have always treated me courteously, and fair but the women in our family are also treated with the utmost respect and kindness. Mckaig is the kind of dealership that you highly recommend to all your friends and even strangers on the street, and I have done both many times. I have traded with many dealerships in my life, but none has been the whole package that Mckaig Chevrolet is, and always will be, because of all the people that make up the dealership. I don't reside in Gladewater Tx, but I choose to make the trip there because of the Mckaig family.

The owners and employees of the dealership were raised in Gladewater and are known and respected by everyone in town.  When I went there looking for a vehicle, I was not pressured or bothered by the sales people.  They allowed me to look and shop and were available when I needed to ask questions.  I wanted a specific car, and when they did not have it, they were willing to find it for me and offered it to me at a very competitive price.  I love my car and am very happy with it.  My husband purchased his truck there also.  We are very pleased with McKaig's car dealership and will shop there again in the future.

Brian and Mark Porter not only got me a fair trade in price, but was able to fight for me to get the 2015 in my price range.

Review: I took my wife to look at the Traverse since that is what she wanted. We found the Equinox would work just as well and with better fuel economy. However, our financial limitations stopped that plan... BUT Lacasha and Mark didn't let us down. They knew we needed to replace my truck with a family vehicle and got us into a Malibu. The wife is VERY happy she got the new car we needed and knows exactly where we're going to go in a couple of years to replace the old Ford car (I'm hoping with a truck).
Bottom line, although I didn't get what I wanted, the folks at McKaig got us into what we could afford so I could continue to build my credit as STILL take care of my family's needs. The whole team checked on us while looking at options and waiting on the accounting folks to lay out a deal for us. They even introduced us to the Service team for the FREE oil changes we will be getting (YAY!)
I really appreciate the time and effort this team puts into the sales and service they offer their customers. GM should be proud of their Gladewater representatives!

We went straight into the dealership and began to tell the salesperson about our experience elsewhere. Sabrina never once asked about down payment or money until she knew who we were and all about what we needed. We arrived at 4:45 and drove home in our new-to-us vehicle that night at 7:30. We were assisted by Sabrina and then Floyd for the paperwork. Both individuals were kind and only had our best interests in mind. As we left that night we told Sabrina that we were going on vacation for a week. When I returned to pick up our tags, she remembered our names, our vacation spot, and even asked about our kids. I would recommend this dealership to anyone who is looking to purchase a new or used car.

Review: We stopped in right before closing time and instead of telling us to come back they allowed us to look at vechicles and test drive one of their trucks. We found a truck that we liked and Jeriamy stayed until really late processing all the paperwork and we were able to drive away in something we wanted. I would reccomend this dealership to anyone looking for a vechicle.

Review: Everyone that we encountered at this dealership was friendly, fair, and honest.  I shopped around at other dealerships and felt like the other dealerships were not near as knowledgable and upfront with me as McKaig.  The financing was very easy.  They had everything ready for me when I walked in.  All I had to do was sign.  I will DEFINITELY recommend this dealership to other people.  In fact, to help promote, I have already &quot;liked&quot; McKaig's page on facebook and posted a picture of my new car!  GREAT company.  I was very impressed, and I plan to come to McKaig for future purchases.

Review: Adrian was amazing at getting us what we needed and wanted. After telling him what our price range, wants and luxuries he picked out exactly what we wanted. He let us take the truck home to assure that's what we wanted and did not rush us through the sale. He made adjustments to it to help complete the look we wanted, and we were sold after that! He was very honest, very patient and was very thorough in showing us all the special offers MckKaig had to offer. We have dealt with other dealers before and always felt rushed/pressured. We are already thinking about what we want to get next and for sure will go back to Adrian and buy from McKaig. We were very happy with our purchase and are loving our new truck :)

Review: My husband and I had been shopping around for vehicles for about a year. We had visited several dealerships and had a lot of &quot;Why don't you take a look and let me know if I can get you anything&quot; accompanied with a lot of sales people standing around talking inside. I had pretty much decided I would keep my vehicle. One day my husband called me and said he had called McKaig to see if they had the kind of truck I was looking for and they did. They also scheduled for us to come in and meet with a &quot;Solutions Specialist&quot;. I had not heard it called that before but my husband was determined to go in and see what they had. When we got there we were immediately greeted and introduced to the Solutions Specialist that we were assigned to. Jenni was wonderful! Very upbeat and sweet, and HELPFUL! She immediately started basic paperwork to check credit and stuff so they could work on that while we looked. (Love the &quot;no wasted time&quot; approach). We (yes this Solution Specialist went with us) went out to the lot and she began showing us the trucks we had asked about! Jeriamy and Sabrina got the paperwork and everything worked out quickly and we left that day with a new truck! Everyone was courteous and smiling and made it a great experience! We definitely recommend McKaig!!!!

Title: "The best car buying experience by far.....!"
Review: I'm a repeat  customer who traveled from marshall, tx passing numerous dealerships along the way. Why? My car buying experience with McKaig for my first vehicle was so extordinary. Bruce my salesman went above and beyond to find the vehicle that was the perfect fit for my family. And Paul the sales manager did an outstanding job with the finance process and following up with us although we were Bruce's clients. Most people cringe went going into a dealship due to pushy salesmen. Mckaig is a family oriented dealership that not only interacted with my wife and I but made sure our young children were comfortable as well. Since my first purchase my mother, Aunt and cousin have driven over 80 miles to come to Mckaig just because of the outstanding customer service and support. My second vehicle purchase this week was a breeze as I expected. I won't ever shop any other dealships in East Texas. I hear Kent and Mark on the radio talking about their business and how it's run. Well I agrees with everything they put out there because the people at mckaig make the car buying experience great. The staff make it there point to get to know you and make you feel like family not another number walking in and out. Special thanks to my favorite salesman Bruce and his outstanding sales manager Paul.

Review: I went to the dealership not thinking there were too many options for me.  The first car that was an option, just would not work for my family.  I am a single mom on a single mama income.  I have to be picky.  Bruce understood this.  He never pressured me into a car that wouldn't work for us.  He kept trying, even when I wanted to just give up.  He was able to find a car that was perfect!  It was something I had said I had wanted in the past, low mileage, great gas mileage, and a payment I can afford.   He almost had to walk on water to find this car!!   Thank you so much for helping me!!

Title: "Good Buying Experience"
Review: My experience at McKaig Chevrolet was exceptional.  Adrian Cortes demonstrated courtesy, professionalism, eager yet real, while maintaining focus from beginning to end.  Never was I left hanging or to wonder what's going on.  I received a clean detailed vehicle to drive off in.

Adrian always made sure I was informed on what was happening when out of his presence.  I would consider it rude and disrespectful to be left alone in a dealership, not knowing whether you are being served or ignored.

The entire staff was friendly and took an interest in all &quot;guests&quot;; not just their own customer.  Necessary bottled water was provided on a very humid day.

No haggling over incidentals by the sales manager.  No &quot;wait you out to change your mind&quot; tactics employed.  It was a good sales experience.  The business mood demonstrated a desire for my business in an honest, old fashioned way.

The closing was fantastic;very clear and precise.  Sabrina did a good job.

I do recommend McKaig Chevrolet to friends and family if you want a good vehicle-buying experience.

Review: We traded our 2011 Tahoe for a 2014 Silverado during Chevy Truck Month.  Mike Lambert was a jewel to work with.  My husband will not &quot;do the new car thing&quot; so I was tasked with getting what he wanted in a new truck.  Mike went above and beyond to make it happen before the end of the month.  He worked with me on trade (fairly and without high pressure sales tactic) and we &quot;did the deal&quot; in a matter of minutes rather than hours.  It was truly a pleasure to work with our hometown dealer again and enjoy the family atmosphere.  (I had my equinox serviced while we settled the paperwork on the car).  This dealership makes every other dealership in the entire East Texas area look less than &quot;gold star.&quot;  We enjoy the conversation on catching up with their hunting and fishing as well as their attention to customer service.  Mike spent about an hour going over every feature in the new truck and for my non-technical husband, this was certainly a &quot;lesson.&quot;  Again, we had the final price the day before we &quot;did the deal&quot; and with cashier's check in hand, there was no last minute haggling or dealing - it was easy breezy and we are HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY!  THank you Mike Lambert and McKaig Chevrolet for making truck buying fun instead of a chore!

If it had not been for her showing as much interest in getting my service, and being a very nice person on the phone I may have gone somewhere else. I made an appointment to stop in and see some vehicles. I was really surprised that as I drove up to the door, I was met by a salesman, Mike Lambert,and his 1st words were &quot;how are you doing Mr.Ballard &quot;?  I was shocked and surprised. At other dealer ships you can walk around forever without anyone acknowledge you were even there. Everyone went above and beyond what I ever expected. I got what I wanted and they McKaig got a very happy customer,and I will let everyone I know where I got my car. I know I've forgotten some names,but I will never forget you as a person. Thanks again for your help in me getting my newer car...

Review: We searched at least a dozen dealers online, spoke with most of them on the phone.  From what they promised, we visited several of the dealerships in Tyler, Longview and a couple of small towns.  Each time we visited in person, the sales person told us something entirely different than we were told to get us there -- a kind of bait and switch. -- From the get-go, McKaig people were like a breath of fresh air.
Faye Hinds was helpful online and on the phone. -- Annette Preston worked tirelessly to find us exactly the car that we wanted at the price we wanted.  She kept us informed and went above and beyond to get us that car. -- We drove Cadillacs for 30 years.  Annette really had a hill to climb to get us into a Chevrolet with which we would be happy.  She came through with flying colors. -- We have already recommend Annette and McKaig to friends -- some of whom already drive Chevrolets.

purchase of a new 2014 Impala LTZ2.  We have bought many vehicles there and have
also used their service department because they have earned our trust over many 
years of dealing with them.  Thanks again for a job well done.

Review: This dealership worked with me to get me as close as they could to the deal that I wanted; they gave me everything I could need on their end, it was the auto-loan companies for which I had an issue.  The only thing I would request more from this dealership is to make sure everything in the care is working properly, thankfully my problems were only minor fuse problems which I fixed myself.

Title: "When I went into the dealership, I was immediately asked..."
Review: When I went into the dealership, I was immediately asked if I needed help. A sales specials was brought to me without wait. Mike asked a few questions and was able to easily help me find what I needed as well as alternatives so that I had options. He was knowledgeable with the product and couple easily answer my questions or concerns. He did well enough that I even bought the 1st vehicle he showed me. He walked me through the whole process and kept me update. I never felt like I was just pushed in a corner to wait. While I was there I believed everybody at the dealership greeted me and asked if I needed anything. Finance was on top of everything and made it simple and easy. Usually sitting in the finance office is a stressful environment, yet I felt very comfortable and at ease. Everything was explained and I never felt pressured. Kent stopped by and made sure everything was going good and talked with me. After the sale the new truck was ready quickly and looked good. Full tank of gas and paper down to protect the carpet. Mike spent easily 30+ mins going over the vehicle with me to make sure I knew where all the controls were at and even set the right time on the clock. He walked me through on-star and even make sure my cell was blue toothed with the truck. This was by far the best car buying experience I have ever had. I would quickly tell anyone to go to this dealership first and they most likely will not have to go to any others.

I really enjoyed buying my car from MCKaig.Everyone I dealt with was very friendly and made my whole experience fun. We had a good afternoon. I think it took a little too long to seal the deal, but I do not know what all is involved. I enjoyed talking to Mark Abernathy, he came over and introduced himself.Noone pressured me.  They knew what I wanted and they made it happen.I especially enjoyed dealing with Stephen and Sabrina.It is a very friendly atmosphere. Thanks for all you did to help me.

Review: To whom it may concern,
I needed a new vehicle in a timely manner since my job depends on it. I am in sales and my job requires me to travel on the road.  My old truck broke down and I was in need of a new one.   I contacted Mr. Josh Johnston at Mckaig who expeditiously found the best, most economical Silverado for me and got me qualified with a lender within hours.  I was then introduced to Mr. Abernathy and Mr. Lambert who assisted with the closing of the deal. I was enjoying my new truck within days.  They even went the extra mile and had some additional windows tented upon my inquiry/request. The friendliness and profdessionalism of all the people at McKaig will definitely make them my first choice for all future vehicle needs/purchases.  I will recommend Mckaig Chevrolet Buick to everyone I know looking for a new car or truck and a dealer who will treat them &quot;right.&quot;
Sincerely,
Marcus Lutz
Proud new owner of a Silverado LS

Review: I went in to McKaig's service department on a Saturday to get my 1998 Olds Intrigue Recall fulfilled.  I met Philip in the front lobby area and asked him if the Pontiac G6 was sold to anyone.  The car has just been driven around from the Service area.  I then inspected the exterior and interior of the vehicle and really liked it.  The vehicle is a 4cyl automatic with cruise control. It is the perfect car for me for work.  I live in Kilgore and travel to Athens, Texas everyday.  Philip and Josh and the other staff members were really nice to me. Even the Service advisor on duty that Saturday congratulated me for coming in for the recall that was a $17 part, but ended purchasing a $17K car. I look forward to getting my Pontiac G6 serviced at McKaig's.

Faye and Sabrina did a great job keeping me informed about the car, and Floyd was upfront and honest in his answers to me.  

I've bought three cars and a truck from this dealership.  After looking for cars from Shreveport to Dallas, I always end up here with at least as good a deal or better than I'd have gotten else where.

Review: My daughter is a very rare 19 year old woman. She recently graduated high-school, will soon attend college, has been employed with the same employer for 3 and 1/2 years and helps support her family. She needed a new, dependable car. She did not have a credit rating and our credit was not good. The folks at McKaig made it possible for a great kid to get a great car. We cannot be more proud and pleased with her purchase. She is now in a dependable, cute little car that she loves and earned! Thank you to all of the people at McKaig for making our little girl's dream come true. Jeremy and Mike are outstanding!

It was a great experience to go buy a car and not be forced into something I didn't want to buy. And it did not take ALLLLLL day to do it either. Brian and Jeriamy are NOT like the salesmen you see in Longview. They were not pushy. While we were in the office signing the paper work Ken Abernathy even came over and talked to us. It is so nice to buy a car in such a friendly place. It makes me want to go and hang out and just sit and talk with them. We will be there in September to buy my son's first car. And the next kids car too. (In 5 years). Thanks again Brian and Jeriamy ya'll are GREAT!!!!!!!!

Review: I've never had any issues with McCaig Chevrolet since I first bought my 2011 silverado, till this last weekend. This may sound petty but I went in for an oil change, paying $60 cause of the particular oil that &quot;has&quot; to be used.  There is a 24 point inspection I believe that is done, one of the inspections that I pay for is to check tread depth and air pressure. It did not happen and had to go back into the service area after leaving to have them do the job the paperwork said they'd already done. Other than that, McCaig always makes it right.

Title: "Great place to buy a car!"
Review: First of all, my wife and I had a five star 100% experience with McKaig, even before we bought a car from them. My wife was on her way to Dallas and I was out of town.  Just before she reached Gladewater, her instrument panel went out in her non-GM car. She pulled into McKaig and was greeted by the service manager Shannon. He assured her it was no problem looking at her issue and was able to correct it! He shook her hand and said no charge. I was so appreciative that they took care of her when she was in such need. 

Last week we tried to repay the favor. I visited McKaig and wash able to work out a competitive deal. They worked very hard on getting me the car I wanted. I can't say enough about the staff. Sabrina was awesome and I think she was excited as I was when we found my car! Kent, Mike and Jeriamy was great as well. 

If you want a no pressure, pleasant car buying experience, give McKaig a chance.

Title: "Our experience."
Review: We just bought a 2016 Chevy Silverado from Mike Lambert at McKaig Chevrolet in Gladewater, Texas and it was a most pleasurable experience. This is the ninth Chevrolet I have owned because I have put over 200,000 miles on all the others with every little major repairs. The latest is a 2003 Tahoe that I bought for my wife's birthday. It now has 197,000 miles and we are still driving it. My other truck is a 2001 Silverado with 188,900 miles on it. My wife wanted to get a new truck for my 65 birthday so I started calling dealerships looking for what I wanted.  I called Mike told him what I was looking for. There was no pressure to sell me something else he found what I wanted, told me how much he could sell it for and then held it for 4 days until my wife and I could get down to see it. We arrived about 4:00 drove it and bought it. Everyone was so nice staying long after 5:00 to get the paper work done. Then Mike stayed nearly another hour showing us how everything worked even pairing our cell phones. Bottom line I drove out of there at 7:00 with a new truck one day after my birthday. I don't trade trucks often but if I ever do so again it will be from Mike Lambert at McMaig Chevrolet in Gladewater, Texas. Thank you big time.        Keith N. Winnsboro, Texas

Review: Just moved to the area.  Had a couple of issues with the car.  Saw that there was a dealership in Gladewater.  Having come from the Dallas area I figured we would be without the car for a couple of days.  Well...nope.  Took it in on a Monday to have it looked at.  Parts had to be ordered.  Made an appointment for the next Monday.  Took it in at 8:00 and the car was ready by 10:00.  That doesn't happen in the Dallas area.  Not to mention, the repairs were fixed and everything works as it should.  Thanks Shannon for your help!

Title: "Shannon in service"
Review: I do a lot of my own service on my vehicles.  Up to this point you couldn't drag me to a dealership for any kind of work, however my experience with Shannon and the service writers at McCaig, Gladewater, was much much better than I expected or have ever experienced.  This is the ONLY dealership I will ever take any of my vehicles to for service.

So we came up here around 5:50 pm and started talking to CT he got me out of my 2010 Dodge Caliber and into a 2013 Hyundai Santa Dr with only 13000 miles. I would recommend anyone to come talk to CT and let him work his magic for you.

Title: "First time buyer"
Review: Although I originally went in for the 2014 Kia Optima they had, I ended up leaving with a 2016 Chevy Cruze. And that's all I could have wanted. Upon arriving, we were offered drinks as we waited for Charles, the solution specialist assigned to us. Being as we were first time buyers, and with a currently troubled credit background, he did all he could to get us in a new vehicle. I couldn't have asked for anything more from him and McKaig, from the greeting to the lifetime free oil changes, my buying experience was perfect. I'm more than happy with the Cruze, and will always recommend McKaig to anyone looking for a new car or truck.

Title: "FANTASTIC CUSTOMER-ORIENTED SERVICE!!!"
Review: I had just moved from Maine to Big Sandy, Texas.  It was quite a drive, so I wanted to schedule a thorough inspection of my 2013 Silverado and change the oil.  A very knowledgeable mechanic that works at ALERT Academy recommended that I go to McKaigs.  He told me that is the &quot;only place&quot; around these parts that HE would recommend.  With that, I made my appointment.  Upon entering the service department, I was greeted by Shannon.  After he got my particulars, he then escorted me to the waiting room and offered me drinks, snacks, and candy!  He was SO polite!  He also showed me where the restrooms were located.

When my truck was done, he came over to the waiting room and sat down next to me with the 27-point inspection in hand.  He, then, began to discuss all the things that their mechanic had evaluated and how my truck had fared.  He also asked me IF I had any questions.

I was then escorted to a lovely lady to pay for my bill.  She was just as charming and professional as Shannon.  

Needless to say, I actually ENJOY going to this fine dealership!  Their very personable/knowledgeable staff and timely service make this dealership a DEFINITE THUMBS UP!!!  

I have NOT (thankfully, my Chevy IS a 2013) had any major repairs, hopefully I will not for many more years----BUT, if I ever need to, I know where I'm heading!

Mike Lambert has sold us many cars so we asked him for help.  He showed us a car that could easily replace our suburban and yet be comfortable to drive, enough room to manage our things, and good gas mileage.  We could not ask for anything more than Mike provided.  He was never sitting still while he was helping us.  He saw that we got everything out of our car, he even put our new keys on our key rings.  He demonstrated the many options on the Traverse when it was time for him to go home.  It is a very pleasant event to buy a car from Mike.  He even remembers us when he sees us dining out.  We enjoy doing business at McKaig.

Elexis came out to help us and was cheerful, even though it was 40 degrees and drizzling rain, and we were &quot;just looking&quot; at that time. Two days later, she closed the deal for us. Justin came through with the pricing and warranty end. He's even running down a full-sized spare for me. Now, that's service!  
 The Trax really delivers...lots of headroom,(I'm 6'5&quot;)...Rearview camera...4G LTE connection...OnStar....Bluetooth....7&quot; Touchscreen...all stock on the 1LS. That's the economy model, folks! Less than 20K on the door!

Title: "BEYOND BELIEF!"
Review:    In all my years I have never found buying an automobile a pleasant experience UNTIL this week.  With total dread and an ill feeling in my stomach I entered McKaig Chevrolet on the insistence of my son.  He had told me they treat people right. Move heard nothing but good about them, give them a try.  So I went, very skeptical, somewhat defensive from verbal abuse at another dealership, only to be greeted with warmth and genuine friendliness and what appeared to be genuine caring.  At no time was I stressed nor pressured.  This place wasn't into games.  I was and am in total shock over what a pleasant experience this was.  I've had some difficulties and they listened and worked their magic.  I worked with Elexis Coby and Floyd was her manager.  They absolutely treated me with fairness and respect.  I left with a 2015 Malibu and I am very happy with it and am totally overwhelmed with the CUSTOMER SERVICE that I believe is the heart of McKaig Chevrolet.

Review: My husband and I had just come from another local dealership as we were looking at the possibility of purchasing a used vehicle.  While we looked over the Tahoe's on the lot, we were approached by Mr. Brian Pilcher.  He was very unassuming, as he answered any questions we had about the vehicle.  We felt no pressure whatsoever, but a genuine interest in what we wanted.  We left the dealership that day, telling Brian we would be back the next day.  
I returned the next day with my eight year old son.  We were brought in and seated at Brian's desk while he dealt with the finance guys.  We spent two hours at the dealership, I told Brian that I had some errands to run, and instead of keeping us there the entire time, he allowed us to take the Tahoe to run errands and to taxi our other children to and from the Yamboree events.  It was then that I decided I had to have the vehicle!  
When my son and I returned a few hours later, my husband joined us and we &quot;sealed the deal&quot;.  Brian was so pleasant to work with and showed a genuine interest in us as people.  I would highly recommend him and this fabulous dealership to anyone looking for a used or new vehicle.  We will definitely return for car purchases in the future! It was raining the day we bought the Tahoe, so Brian told us to return the following week to have the vehicle detailed.  Thanks Brian for all you did for us!!

Review: My family and I have been doing business with McKaigs for about 20 years..Recently we purchase 4 different vehicles from them in the last 6 months. They are always very friendly during the sales part of our transaction, but they always remember my family after the sale. The service department is always prompt and eager to help us....They have never left my wife stranded whenever I have been out of town and not able to take care of her car issues....I recommend them to everyone that I know looking for new or used car....

Title: "My Engine Light is ON!!"
Review: McKaig has always been able to work my service into their schedules in a timely manner.  I usually need a loaner car or I need to be taken to work, while leaving my auto for service.  They have always happily done this for me.  I work about 20 minutes away from the dealership. I had an &quot;extensive&quot; tune up completed on my car, but after picking it up on Friday evening, my engine light came on. Of course, it was a holiday weekend, so on Tuesday morning I arrived at the dealership, after calling ahead and by the end of the day, they had replaced a coil and got my car up and running, no charge.  Thank you, McKaig and John in the service department.

Title: "Great, No Pressure Car Buying Experience"
Review: My wife Linda and I have been shopping for her new car about 3 weeks. We were undecided when we started what make of vehicle to buy. In all we visited 6 dealers of compact/midsize SUV's. Linda has driven Honda CR-V's for the last 20 years and we thought that might be our choice for her again. During that time period we went to see Mike Lambert three times, unannounced, and he took the time to answer all of our questions without fail. He worked for us between visits to provide what we needed and to keep us informed. As we communicated to Mike what we required finance wise, he worked with his sales manager, Jeriamy, and finance manager, Johnny, to work out the details to keep us from having to meet with half of the dealership's employees like we did at some dealers. Mike knows his stuff and does a great job helping customers. We enjoyed our time with Sabrina signing all of the documents required with a new car purchase. She kept what could have been drudgery light-hearted and fun. Mike gave us a good orientation on the car's operation - something that someone that hasn't purchased a new car in ten years sorely needed. Go to see McKaig - they are like family.........

Review: Left my Corvette for a recall and to diagnose and repair a leak from the rear of the car.  I also asked for them to determine why the car would not get out of park occasionally.  Recall and rear axle seals replaced promptly. The diagnosis of the other issue was more difficult.  We decided to pick the car up since they weren't able to pinpoint the exact problem without just replacing expense parts.  Thankful that they didn't try to start replacing things that might not be the problem.

Review: We took a vehicle in that had quite a few problems. Within a day, I was given an estimate for the repair costs of everything to fix the car. I was given the option to fix only the things that I wanted and wasn't pushed into fixing the things that weren't immediate, like the sun roof. Because of the nature of this particular vehicle, I had to bring the car back a few times for minor adjustments. Even though there were no more charges, I was still given the same attention that I would have received if I spent $15,000 on repairs. Honest, timely, respectful, personable, and understanding of a person's finances.

After getting fed up with the stereotypical &quot;car salesman&quot; back and forth charades for several hours, my wife and I left.  The next day I called Phillip and he found exactly what I was looking for by the following day.  Very easy to deal with.  I hate the hassling back and forth nonsense and philip is not like that at all.  The finance guy Josh was super helpful and explained every thing we were signing in a language we could understand.  Neither man was pushy with offering us extra things. Everyone we worked with at the dealership seem like down home normal people and we like that.  Would definitely recommend Mckaig and will continue to use them for future purchases.

Everyone at McKaig is friendly, helpful, and &quot;genuinely sincere&quot; about their service.  The transaction was smooth and uncomplicated.  I will continue to buy from McKaig and from Phillip.

Title: "Great no pressure sales "
Review: This was both the first and last dealership I visited in my search for a vehicle. First because they had the best price on the vehicle I wanted check out. Last because the first visit went so well. In between I visited other dealerships in Tyler, but each one either did not have the vehicles I wanted to check or because the sales representatives were so high pressure that I left as quickly as possible. In the end I came back to McKaig to look at the first vehicle. I called and spoke again to Jason and arranged to come back later that evening. Life happens and I ran late. He stayed to meet me at 10 minutes to closing. I was able to test drive and really go over the vehicle again. I did decide I wanted the vehicle. We started the (usually) long process of haggling. Instead of it being a long back and forth, it was quick and easy. Then he and two other employees stayed until the deal was done. It was almost 10 pm before we finished and none of them complained. After the sale, I realized the the oil needed changing. I brought up to their attention and they changed it. It has been the easiest vehicle purchase I have ever made. Jason has followed up with me, but not intrusively.  Anyone in the market for a new or new to you vehicle, McKaig is the place to buy.

Mike Lambert went above and beyond helping us with purchase and familiarizing us with Nav and other systems. All around, one of my better experiences with dealership period.

Title: "We have bought many cars in the last 20+ years of..."
Review: We have bought many cars in the last 20+ years of marriage, but none has come close to matching our experience at McKaig. From the start, Brian Pilcher set the tone for the day, made us feel at home, never pressured, and was genuinely trying to help us find the right fit for our family. I grew up in the car business, so I know how it works...but the staff at McKaig was nothing like the stereotypes...all the way through financing and closing. We got the perfect vehicle for the right price and have no regret whatsoever. This team breaks the mold and goes the 2nd mile when it comes to customer service and walking the talk &quot;for the people&quot;. We will never buy another vehicle from anyone other than McKaig...guaranteed!!!

I am widowed and need support in taking care of my vehicle.  I need to know that my dealership will be there when I need them.  From my first encounter EVERYONE at McKaig was truly friendly, sincere and ready to help me.  I did not encounter an employee who did not greet me with a smile and asked if they could help me.  It is obvious that their employees like their jobs, like customers and are truly glad to be of any assistance to their customers.  This service is extremely rare today.

I just traded for a 2015 Silverado and Mike worked very hard to satisfy my needs. It meant getting a truck from another dealer. He is still trying to show me how to operate all the whistles and bells.

She listened to our needs and tailored her suggestions based on what we told her. We decided not to buy at that time. When we started looking again last week, we looked at other dealerships but kept coming back to McKaig. We bought from Sabrina at McKaig because of all the reasons listed above. Plus, Justin worked to find us a great deal on financing. We have absolutely no complaints about the dealership or the treatment we received there. We'll go back.

Review: We have now bought  three cars, one slightly used Captiva, a new Silverado pickup, and a new Buick Lacross from McKaig Chevrolet in the last 18 months. Mike Lambert is our sales person for each purchase. We return to McKaigs and Mike in particular because we know that we can trust what he tells us about the vehicles, he gives  support after the sales, is warm and helpful each time one of us enters the dealership, and he understands what we mean by no haggle price. Our number one pet peeve is for a salesman to give a price and after it is quoted and we say know to the price and that salesman tells us that he can do better on the price if we just talk to his/her manager. That type of sales tactic always leads to a &quot;no sale&quot; with us. Having known Mike since our children were in Sunday School together, we know he is a person of good character, high integrity, and is a man of his word. 
Thank you for the opportunity to share how pleased we are with our three purchases from Mike Lambert at McKaigs Cheverolet and Buick in Gladewater, TX

Review: I had been looking for a new car for awhile, I saw online that McKaig had one I was interested in a Chevy Equinox . I contacted Faye Hinds and she told me to stop in and take a look at it. When I got to the dealership I was met by Annette, Faye had set me up with her as my salesperson. Annette had already pulled the Chevy Equinox  up that I wanted to see and it was waiting for me. She showed me all the features that it had and we took it for a spin. I loved it and really wanted to get it but, my problem was that I was so upside down on my trade, that I was afraid I was not going to be able to get it since I had been hitting a brick wall at  other dealerships I had stopped at. We then went to talk to Floyd the finance Manager to see if we could make something happen. He did everything he could on his end to get me this car, he was able to give me more for my trade and took some off the price of the new car. We were able to make a deal I could live with. I would recommend McKaig to anyone who wants to find a new car, they really do, do all they can to make it happen. Thanks, Faye, Annette and Floyd for making it happen for me. You all were GREAT!

Review: My truck had given up the ghost and I had bought a vehicle from McKaig in 98 so thought would start there looking for a vehicle. Upon entering the store, I was met by Mike Lambert. Mike listened to my needs and then took me to the lot to look at used trucks. What I wanted was a little out of my price range so Mike gave me other options. I found a 2015 Suv but explained to Mike I was going to look at another dealer before I purchased a vehicle. Mike told me he understood and did not pressure me. My wife and I walked out the exit door and stopped for a moment to discuss the vehicle, then turned around and reentered the store and told Mike he just sold a vehicle. I know I rambled a bit but the whole experience from meeting Mike to driving off the lot was pleasant. No pressure. No pressure. I would highly  recommend anyone reading this to give McKaig a chance for your business.

Review: From the first contact with Sabrina online to working with Mike, the experience has been very positive. I told Sabrina what I was looking for, she set Mike Lambert to work on it and within a very short period of time, Mike had found my car. I was looking for a new 2013 Chevy Malibu LTZ. I was trading in a 2011 Chevy Malibu LTZ and wanted to get into new 2013 for the rebates and pricing. After talking with Mike about what I wanted he went to work immediately and found my car in the color (white) and LTZ package that I wanted. I had previously purchased four Chevy's over the last 5+ years from another dealer and tried to return to the same dealer to buy my next car but they could not find the car I wanted. Within two days, Mike had me in my new 2013 Malibu. Mike and I hit it off right from the start. He and the rest of the staff at McKaig's treated me 1st class. There was no high pressure sales pitch. Everything was done professionally all the way through and through. I have been a Chevy customer for over 19 years. I have had positive experiences with all the various dealers where I have lived but McKaig's ranks #1 in my book. I look forward to a long lasting relationship with this dealer.

Review: I LEFT THIS DEALERSHIP FEELING LIKE I WAS LEAVING FAMILY.  I first started corresponding online with Sabrina in June 2013, looking at a new LaCrosse (the Shaq commercial sold me...).  Circumstances didn't allow for a purchase right then, but we stayed in touch over the months... but at no time was I EVER pressured.  In December I started leaning towards the Verano, and finally went in for a test drive on Dec 14.  Sabrina wasn't in at the time, but Brian patiently took me through the test drive.  That didn't turn out to be a good fit, so we moved on (with NO exasperation.  Incredible.)  In one of our emails, I had mentioned to Sabrina my ideal the color scheme... and then I saw the most gorgeous Encore - in my colors!  Funny how that worked out.  :-)     I traded in an older car and received an extremely fair trade in.  Jeriamy worked tirelessly with me to make sure my payments were where I needed them to be.  My last new car purchase was in 1995 and I was pretty much dreading buying a new one.... so I will definitely come back here for my next vehicle purchase.

Review: McKaig's service department is amazing. My 2014 Traverse was having serious engine problems and a Longview dealer gave me a really hard time when it came to getting it into their service department and getting it fixed. After two weeks of a nightmare experience, I still had a smoking car and no where to take it. I felt like I couldn't trust any Chevy dealership after the horrible service that I received. I looked around online and saw the positive reviews that McKaig has received for their service department and I gave them a call. Aaron Abernathy answered the phone and I told him my long saga. He told me to bring it in right away and that he would set me up with a loaner and get it diagnosed. Not only did they diagnose my car, Patrick very patiently explained what was the problem, what may have caused it and offered several options to fixing it to help suit the financial burden of the repair. He even took the time out of his schedule to also meet with my husband and have to same conversation so that we could decide confidently on a solution. This is definitely something that I have never gotten at any dealership especially one that I didn't even buy the car from. I will definitely bring my car back for all of the servicing that it needs and I will sing their praises.

The cars were purchased from area dealerships, although I did my research I left both places with vehicles and a bad experience after the purchase. I could not get a dealer to return my calls or emails with regard to a purchase 5 months ago. I went to McKaig not thinking I could get a car with the amount I owed on the car. Charles and Floyd worked to get me out of my car and into a new one, Chevy Cruze! A week later my daughter needed to get out of her vehicle and I turned to MCKaig again without hesitation. Charles did it again and my daughter is excited about her car. With the second car, Clark called me back within an hour to let me know he could reduce my payment. Over 30 years, I have  purchased numerous cars and have never recommended a dealership, but I wholeheartedly recommend McKaig Chevrolet.

Title: "Great experience"
Review: My wife and I purchased a new 2015 Chevrolet Tahoe. We test drove a couple of vehicles and settled on the Tahoe. Mike Lambert was our sales person. What a great guy. Very pleasant and easy going. NO PRESSURE..... They did not have the exact vehicle that we were looking for so Mike jumped on the computer, found what we were looking for at a Dallas dealership and had it here in no time. The part that really impressed me about this dealership and Mike in particular. I did not get off until 6PM which meant we did not arrive at Mckaig until 6:30PM.  (Dealership normally closes at 5:30PM) Mike made out like it was no big deal and actually stayed till 8PM delivering and explaining everything about the new Tahoe. I have purchased my two previous trucks from Mckaig and wouldn't think about going to another dealership to make my purchase....I have tried to get lower prices at other dealerships here in east Texas. Just haven't been able to do so.

Title: "Ecstatic!!!"
Review: We just bought our first vehicle from McKaig Chevrolet Buick in Gladewater, TX today and it was the best experience we have ever had in purchasing a vehicle.  First of all the weather didn't help the situation with the 10 plus inches of rain we got in the last 4 days.  After looking around we found a truck that we liked but they didn't have in it the color we wanted but that was not problem for them.  They went out of their way to find the same truck in the color red that we requested and kept the price down to what we had agreed on.  Once the truck was in our sales rep, Bruce Wike showed us everything we need to know about the truck and did not rush us through this process.  Do not go anywhere else to buy or service a vehicle, McKaig is your place.  They will go out of their way every single time to get you as a customer and keep you as a satisfied customer.  It's just that simple.  No hassle, no haggle, no stress, just great service.

I asked one question &quot;what can we do to get her in the car she wanted&quot; and Sabrina went to work as well as Floyd. To sum up her story we left the lot more than happy. The word has yet to be created. Later that day I began to think of my lease and how much it will affect me in the long run. My number one dream car is to own my own Camaro, so I began to do some online research and saw a 2012 blue Camaro and I thought I deserved that car! I told my girlfriend and she said she will let Sabrina know i was thinking of getting out of my lease. Thats when ford decided to contact me to see if i was unhappy, took over a year to get a response from our salesman, and to see what vehicle I wanted. I told him I wanted a Camaro or a Challenger and he just asked if i was interested in a Mustang, I under stood why he asked but thats not what I wanted. Sabrina, on her off day might I say, told  my girlfriend that she thinks we should come in, we did and the joy I kept on the inside was like a kid in a candy store! I got a 2014 Camaro. I did not care if it was a basic model the fact she got me in the car I wanted means a lot! I can truly say she is the best salesperson I have ever come in contact with and when its time for a new car for anyone I know i will always recommend Mckaig!

Title: "My husband and I looked around the lot and stepped into..."
Review: My husband and I looked around the lot and stepped into the sales trailer. They maybe under construction but they that doesn't stop them from being organized. We first came into contact with Brian Pilcher, I thought we were gonna have to take him home being we had never bought a new car ever. It being my Birthday and Us being married 35 yrs the next day ( no one knew). We were treated like royalty. he picked the perfect car suited to our needs just based on our description. Then we met Jeriamy briefly but he left a warm impression. Then Johnny Ortiz got us for last little details  what kind of insurance you know minor stuff. We went out and Brian had to teach us how everything worked cause we sure didn't. We didn't use our old car as a trade-in probably should have. It broke down in the lot.  In comes the Service Department, and Doyle Dougan ,and Mike Lambert they tried to crank it, No luck look's likes, charge the battery.  Next day no charge doesn't work ,needs battery. Change battery still not right, needs alternator. Replace alternator  FIXED !!!!!!!!!! While husband tying up loose ends in shop. Annette is standing in the hot sun talking with me she doesn't have but she is, This young lady is the sweetest I've met in a while. So to those reading this  watch out and better hang on to her she will be taking the SALES SOLUTIONS by FORCE!!!!!!!!!!!      We would recommend McKaig Cheverolet from the NEW CAR SALES to the   SERVICE DEPARTMENT   !!!!!!!!!!!!

Title: "I went into McKaig after doing research on the internet..."
Review: I went into McKaig after doing research on the internet of a pickup that i thought was going to be in my best interest.  When arriving at the dealership I was welcomed by a very friendly female named Annette Preston.  She took me around the entire dealership explaining features and benefits of all the vehicles on the lot.  After a good period of time, and her really breaking down the whole culture of McKaig and their policy of  giving customers the ultimate buying experiences it was apparent to me that I was not at any ordinary dealership.  It was brought to my attention that I was dealing with not a sales person ... but a solutions specialist, I was also amazed with the fact that these solution specialist aren't even paid by commission.  She was not there to push me into buying just any vehicle, but there to help me figure out what was best for ME!! After hrs of contemplating what to do Annette felt the need for me to go into her manager's office and discuss my questions and concerns that she so openly told me were above her.  After sitting yet ANOTHER hour with her manager Floyd Rucks with no interruptions just an open ear ... instead of Floyd persuading me into just purchasing one of their vehicles he consulted me on the many avenues to go in order to help my payment situation on my current truck AND how I could help some of my credit issues.  So to sum up my experience at McKaig is very simple.  It was one of the most relaxed non pressure experiences at a car dealership ... I went in on edge not knowing which way I was going to go and after my time there I actually walked out not even purchasing a vehicle but full of knowledge of how to handle my current vehicle AND fix some of my credit.  I actually feel like left that dealership with two new friends, a kind, knowledgeable, and might I add beautiful solutions specialist named Annette Preston ... and a very no nonsense honest solutions manager named Floyd Rucks.  When the time is right ... I will be purchasing my new pick up there and without a doubt  I will send anybody and everybody I run across that is in the market for a nicer newer vehicle Annette's way! Thanks McKaig for showing me that this is no ordinary dealership.

Title: "Typical service for a female"
Review: When I was looking for a car I was impressed with McKaig even though I did not buy there. I bought a Toyota.  I decide to stop in for an oil change this week due to my past positive experience. It ended up being the same old game for a female going to a repair shop.  I was told my battery was leaking and that she would hate for me to get stranded on a really hot day or cold day. Since I was going out of town, the next day, I was worried but their battery was $198 dollars. So I went across the street to an auto parts store and they had no idea why she would have said my battery was leaking and that he didn't see why I would need a new battery. Of course, McKaig tried to sell me on new filters like every other place and I am OK with that but pushing a battery is too much. I had intended to buy a Tahoe next and was going to try speak with them first... not now! Service department says a lot about the company. Same old game that I am not interested in playing.

Title: "Buy Here-Nowhere Else"
Review: I hate to buy vehicles because of pushy Sales people.  Michel Odom at McKaig Chevrolet is NOT that pushy salesperson and really went out of his way to make my experience as stress free as possible. My husband started the process because of my hate for buying a vehicle.  Michael allowed him to drive the vehicle to me so that I could drive it without all the sales talk. No harassing conversations or phone calls.  He let me talk, he listened, and allowed me to make my decision, not him making it for me. 

Sabrina and Johnny finished with the paperwork.  They were cordial and informative and made every effort to move the process along quickly.  

We have already told several people about our wonderful, stress free experience at McKaig Chevrolet in Gladewater, TX and recommend they go there for their next vehicle purchase.

Title: "No ethics"
Review: We were searching for a new vehicle and we went through the Team National Dealer Mall to find a Dealership. We made an appointment two days prior with the correct contact for buying through Team National and when we got there they gave us a different salesman but that he knew the process for the TN deal. Our experience with McKaig in Gladewater, TX started out great and we thought we were taken care of till a week later. McKaig called and told us to bring the car back because the deal was not final and that the contract was not valid. They informed us that WE had to call GMC Financial to finalize the contract and that they weren’t going to pay off the trade-in. (motorcycle) At this time we were informed that NO we didn’t get the Team National discount or the Veteran discount. We were told that we received the 20% discount that everyone receives walking through their door. When we signed the papers at the dealership we were told we were getting the TN, the Vet, and the 20% discount. When we received the call from McKaig we were told NO we were not given the TN or the Vet discount because McKaig doesn’t do all three it is what McKaig chooses in the end. The next day we were on the way to take the car back and retrieve our motorcycle (the trade-in) only to be informed that they didn’t know where our bike was and that the owner refused to speak with us. My husband did continue to the dealership and a salesman came out to Donny and informed him that the Dealership would try and locate the motorcycle and make this right.  From this point forward NO ONE at McKaig would take our calls or return messages and at this time Harley Davidson was still asking where the payoff of the bike was!!! We have informed the BBB of their ethics problem and also have starting working with an attorney on this matter. We will be informing the very large membership of Team National not to waste their time with McKaig Chevrolet Buick!
